Privet Drive
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
----------------------------------------------
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, Mr. Dursley watched a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive in Mr. Dursley mirror.
----------------------------------------------
It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley gave Mr. Dursley a little shake and put a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive out of Mr. Dursley mind.
----------------------------------------------
The cat was staring down Privet Drive as though The cat were waiting for something.
----------------------------------------------
the cat on the wall outside was sitting as still as a statue, the cat on the wall outside eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive.
----------------------------------------------
Nothing like A man had ever been seen on Privet Drive.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore clicked the silver Put- Outer once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and Albus Dumbledore could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
----------------------------------------------
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
By the time The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor was allowed out of The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley’s had already broken Dudley’s new video camera, crashed Dudley’s remote control airplane, and, first time out on Dudley’s racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as old Mrs. Figg crossed Privet Drive on old Mrs. Figg crutches.
----------------------------------------------
Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald- green ink.
----------------------------------------------
Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, Privet Drive — ’ ” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
silently was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when letters got back that Harry’d be able to steal one somehow.
----------------------------------------------
the castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had.
----------------------------------------------
It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.
----------------------------------------------

*************************************************
Mr. Dursley
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although Mr. Dursley did have a very large mustache.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as Mr. Dursley spent so much of Mr. Dursley time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley had everything Mr. Dursley wanted, but Mr. Dursley also had a secret, and Mr. Dursley greatest fear was that somebody would discover .
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley didn’t think Mr. Dursley could bear if anyone found out about the Potters.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but Mr. Dursley hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mr. Dursley pretended Mr. Dursley didn’t have a sister, because Mr. Dursley sister and Mr. Dursley good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but the Potters had a small son, too had never even seen a small son.
----------------------------------------------
When Mr. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley hummed as Mr. Dursley picked out Mr. Dursley most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as Mrs. Dursley wrestled a screaming Dudley into Mr. Dursley high chair.
----------------------------------------------
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up Mr. Dursleybriefcase, pecked Mr. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing Dudley cereal at the walls.
----------------------------------------------
“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursleyas Mr. Dursley left the house.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley got into Mr. Dursley car and backed out of number four’s drive.
----------------------------------------------
It was on the corner of the street that Mr. Dursley noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map.
----------------------------------------------
For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what Mr. Dursleyhad seen — then Mr. Dursley jerked Mr. Dursley head around to look again.
----------------------------------------------
What could Mr. Dursley have been thinking of?
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, Mr. Dursley watched a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive in Mr. Dursley mirror.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley gave Mr. Dursley a little shake and put a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive out of Mr. Dursley mind.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley drove toward town Mr. Dursley thought of nothing except a large order of drills Mr. Dursley was hoping to get that day.
----------------------------------------------
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of Mr. Dursley mind by something else.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley sat in the usual morning traffic jam, Mr. Dursley couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people!
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley supposed this was some stupid new fashion.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley drummed Mr. Dursley fingers on the steering wheel and Mr. Dursley eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of They weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than man was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!
----------------------------------------------
But then The nerve of him struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something ...
----------------------------------------------
The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, Mr. Dursley mind back on drills.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley always sat with Mr. Dursley back to the window in Mr. Dursley office on the ninth floor.
----------------------------------------------
If Mr. Dursley hadn’t, Mr. Dursley might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; people pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley yelled at five different people.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when Mr. Dursley thought Mr. Dursley’d stretch Mr. Dursley legs and walk across the road to buy Mr. Dursley a bun from the bakery.
----------------------------------------------
He’d forgotten all about five different people until Mr. Dursley passed a group of five different people next to the baker’s.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley eyed five different people angrily as Mr. Dursley passed.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley didn’t know why, but five different people made Mr. Dursley uneasy.
----------------------------------------------
This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and Mr. Dursley couldn’t see a single collecting tin.
----------------------------------------------
It was on Mr. Dursley way back past five different people, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that Mr. Dursley caught a few words of what five different people were saying.
----------------------------------------------
“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” “ — yes, five different people son, Harry — ” Mr. Dursley stopped dead.
----------------------------------------------
Fear flooded Mr. Dursley.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley looked back at the whisperers as if Mr. Dursley wanted to say something to them, but thought better of the whisperers.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley dashed back across the road, hurried up to Mr. Dursley office, snapped at Mr. Dursley secretary not to disturb Mr. Dursley, seized Mr. Dursley telephone, and had almost finished dialing Mr. Dursley home number when Mr. Dursley changed Mr. Dursley mind.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley put the receiver back down and stroked Mr. Dursley mustache, thinking ...
----------------------------------------------
no, Mr. Dursley was being stupid.
----------------------------------------------
It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the tiny old man was wearing a violet cloak.
----------------------------------------------
Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!” And the tiny old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley had been hugged by a complete stranger.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley also thought Mr. Dursley had been called a Muggle, whatever that was.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was rattled.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping Mr. Dursley was imagining things, which Mr. Dursley had never hoped before, because Mr. Dursley didn’t approve of imagination.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing Mr. Dursley saw — and it didn’t improve Mr. Dursley mood — was the tabby cat Mr. Dursley’d spotted that morning.
----------------------------------------------
the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning was now sitting on Mr. Dursley garden wall.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was sure the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning was the same one; the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning had the same markings around the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
----------------------------------------------
the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning just gave Mr. Dursley a stern look.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley wondered.
----------------------------------------------
Trying to pull Mr. Dursley together, Mr. Dursley let Mr. Dursley into the house.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was still determined not to mention anything to Mr. Dursley wife.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley had had a nice, normal day.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley told Mr. Dursley over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with Mr. Dursley daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”).
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.
----------------------------------------------
But I can promise a wet night tonight.” Mr. Dursley sat frozen in Mr. Dursley armchair.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.
----------------------------------------------
He’d have to say something to Mr. Dursley.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley cleared Mr. Dursley throat nervously.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?” As Mr. Dursley had expected, Mr. Dursley looked shocked and angry.
----------------------------------------------
After all, they normally pretended Mr. Dursley didn’t have a sister.
----------------------------------------------
“No,” Mr. Dursley said sharply.
----------------------------------------------
“Why?” “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled.
----------------------------------------------
and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today ...” “So?” snapped Mr. Dursley.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley crowd.” Mr. Dursley sipped Mr. Dursley tea through pursed lips.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley wondered whether Mr. Dursley dared tell Mr. Dursley Mr. Dursley’d heard “Harry.” Mr. Dursley decided Mr. Dursley didn’t dare.
----------------------------------------------
Instead Mr. Dursley said, as casually as Mr. Dursley could, “Owls son — Mr. Dursley’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t Mr. Dursley?” “I suppose so,” said Mr. Dursley stiffly.
----------------------------------------------
Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.
----------------------------------------------
While Mr. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.
----------------------------------------------
Was Mr. Dursley imagining things?
----------------------------------------------
if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, Mr. Dursley didn’t think Mr. Dursley could bear it.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in Mr. Dursley mind.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley last, comforting thought before Mr. Dursley fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for even if the Potters were involved to come near Mr. Dursley and Mr. Dursley.
----------------------------------------------
the Potters knew very well what Mr. Dursley and Petunia thought about even if the Potters were involved and even if the Potters were involved kind.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley couldn’t see how Mr. Dursley and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — Mr. Dursley yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect he and Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
How very wrong Mr. Dursley was.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness.
----------------------------------------------
their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls held no sign at a large blond boylived in the house, too.
----------------------------------------------
MR. DURSLEY!
----------------------------------------------

*************************************************
Dudley
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
----------------------------------------------
a small son was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; the Potters didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley hummed as Mr. Dursley picked out Mr. Dursley most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as Mrs. Dursley wrestled a screaming Dudley into Mr. Dursley high chair.
----------------------------------------------
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up Mr. Dursleybriefcase, pecked Mr. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing Dudley cereal at the walls.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley told Mr. Dursley over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with Mr. Dursley daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”).
----------------------------------------------
When Dudley had been put to bed, Dudley went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
----------------------------------------------
Instead Mr. Dursley said, as casually as Mr. Dursley could, “Owls son — Mr. Dursley’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t Mr. Dursley?” “I suppose so,” said Mr. Dursley stiffly.
----------------------------------------------
One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was special, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as Mrs. Dursley opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing, nothing ...” Dudley’s birthday — how could ” Dudley’s birthday have forgotten?
----------------------------------------------
The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents.
----------------------------------------------
The table looked as though Dudley’s had gotten the new computer Dudley’s wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike.
----------------------------------------------
Exactly why Dudley’s wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley’s was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but Dudley’s couldn’t often catch Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked even smaller and skinnier than Harry really was because all Harry had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley’s was about four times bigger than Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley’s had punched Harry on the nose.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley’s arrived in the kitchen with his mother.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s looked a lot like Uncle VernonUncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on Dudley’s thick, fat head.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petuniaoften said that Dudley’s looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley’s looked like a pig in a wig.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s, meanwhile, was counting Dudley’s presents.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s face fell.
----------------------------------------------
“Thirty-six,” Dudley’s said, looking up at Dudley’s mother and father.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s two less than last year.” “Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.” “All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley’s, going red in His face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down Dudley bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley’s turned the table over.
----------------------------------------------
Is that all right?” Dudley thought for a moment.
----------------------------------------------
Finally Dudley said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty ...
----------------------------------------------
“Oh.” Dudley’s sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel.
----------------------------------------------
’Atta boy, Dudley’s!” Atta boy, Dudley!” ruffled his money’s hair.
----------------------------------------------
At that moment the telephone rang and His Aunt Petuniawent to answer the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley’s unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.
----------------------------------------------
Atta boy, Dudley!” was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when His Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
----------------------------------------------
his money’s can’t take Atta boy, Dudley!”.” his money’s jerked his money’s head in Harry’s direction.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s’s mouth fell open in horror, but his money’s heart gave a leap.
----------------------------------------------
Every year on Dudley’s’s birthday, Dudley’s parents took Dudley’s and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies.
----------------------------------------------
“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what Harry wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer) .
----------------------------------------------
...” Dudley’s began to cry loudly.
----------------------------------------------
In fact, Dudley’s wasn’t really crying — it had been years since Dudley’s’d really cried — but Dudley’s knew that if Dudley’s screwed up Dudley’s face and wailed, Dudley’s would give Dudley’s anything Dudley’s wanted.
----------------------------------------------
“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let Dudley’s spoil your special day!” his mother cried, flinging his mother arms around Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
t-t-to come!” Dudley’syelled between huge, pretend sobs.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s always sp- spoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with Dudley’s .
----------------------------------------------
a scrawny boy was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley’shit their.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s stopped pretending to cry at once.
----------------------------------------------
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe Dudley’s luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley’s, on the way to the zoo for the first time in Dudley’s life.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with Dudley’s, but before His aunt and uncle’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
----------------------------------------------
Once, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair so short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had laughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was already laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Next morning, however, Dudley’s had gotten up to find his hair exactly as his hair had been before His Aunt Petunia had sheared his hair off.
----------------------------------------------
Another time, His Aunt Petunia had been trying to force His Aunt Petunia into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls).
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s gang had been chasing Harry as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there Harry was sitting on the chimney.
----------------------------------------------
It was even worth being with Dudley’s and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, Dudley’s cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.
----------------------------------------------
While Dudley’s drove, Uncle Vernon complained to His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what Harry wanted before they could hurry Harry away, they bought Harry a cheap lemon ice pop.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking It as they watched a gorilla scratching It head who looked remarkably like Dudley’s, except that it wasn’t blond.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley’s and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on the animals favorite hobby of hitting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
the animals ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley’s had a tantrum because Dudley’s knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought Dudley’s another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s quickly found the largest snake in the place.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s stood with Dudley’s nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.
----------------------------------------------
“Make it move,” Dudley’s whined at Dudley’s father.
----------------------------------------------
“Do it again,” Dudley’s ordered.
----------------------------------------------
“This is boring,” Dudley’s moaned.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s shuffled away.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its beady eyes to the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“DUDLEY!
----------------------------------------------
COME AND LOOK AT the largest snake in the placeYOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” Dudley’s came waddling toward them as fast as Dudley’s could.
----------------------------------------------
“Out of the way, you,” Dudley’s said, punching Harry in the ribs.
----------------------------------------------
What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley’s were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, Piers and Dudley had leapt back with howls of horror.
----------------------------------------------
Piers and Dudley could only gibber.
----------------------------------------------
As far as Harry had seen, the largest snake in the place hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at Piers and Dudley heels as the largest snake in the place passed, but by the time Piers and Dudley were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley’s was telling Piers and Dudley how the largest snake in the place had nearly bitten off Dudley’s leg, while Piers was swearing the largest snake in the place had tried to squeeze Dudley’s to death.
----------------------------------------------
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to A tiny man in a violet top hat once while out shopping with His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
By the time The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor was allowed out of The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley’s had already broken Dudley’s new video camera, crashed Dudley’s remote control airplane, and, first time out on Dudley’s racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as old Mrs. Figg crossed Privet Drive on old Mrs. Figg crutches.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s’s gang, who visited the house every single day.
----------------------------------------------
Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley’s was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, Dudley’s was the leader.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.
----------------------------------------------
When September came Harry would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in Harry life, Harry wouldn’t be with Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s had been accepted at Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s thought this was very funny.
----------------------------------------------
“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” Dudley’s told Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then Dudley’s ran, before Dudley’s could work out what Dudley’s’d said.
----------------------------------------------
One day in July, His Aunt Petunia took Dudley’s to London to buy His Aunt Petunia Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s.
----------------------------------------------
That evening, Dudley’s paraded around the living room for the family in Dudley’s brand-new uniform.
----------------------------------------------
As he looked at Dudley’s in he new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of he life.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Mrs. Figg’s new uniform.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon opened Uncle Vernon newspaper as usual and Dudley’s banged Uncle Vernon Smelting stick, which Uncle Vernon carried everywhere, on the table.
----------------------------------------------
“Get the mail, Dudley’s,” said Uncle Vernon from behind Uncle Vernon paper.
----------------------------------------------
“Make Harry get it.” “Get the mail, Harry.” “Make Dudley’s get it.” “Poke Dudley’s with your Smelting stick, Dudley’s.” Harry dodged your Smelting stick, Dudley and went to get the mail.
----------------------------------------------
“Ate a funny whelk ...” “Dad!” said Dudley’s suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of Uncle Vernon reach.
----------------------------------------------
Oh my goodness — Vernon!” They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley’s were still in the room.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’swasn’t used to being ignored.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s gave Dudley’s father a sharp tap on the head with Dudley’s Smelting stick.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to read a letter,” Dudley’s said loudly.
----------------------------------------------
“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and Uncle Vernon took both Harryand Dudley’s by the scruffs of both necks and threw both into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind both.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley’s won, so Harry, Harry glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on Harry stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
----------------------------------------------
we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s’s second bedroom.” “Why?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley’s had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s’s first-ever television set, which Dudley’s’d put Dudley’s foot through when Dudley’s favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley’shad swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley’shad sat on it.
----------------------------------------------
From downstairs came the sound of Dudley’s bawling at Dudley’s mother, “I don’t want Dudley’s in there ...
----------------------------------------------
make Dudley’s get out.
----------------------------------------------
Today Dudley’s’d rather be back in this cupboard with that letter than up here without ’d .
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s was in shock.
----------------------------------------------
He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown Dudley’s tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and Dudley’s still didn’t have Dudley’s room back.
----------------------------------------------
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley’s go and get it.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia heard Dudley’s banging things with Dudley’s Smelting stick all the way down the hall.
----------------------------------------------
Then Dudley’s shouted, “There’s another one!
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s — go — just go.” Harry walked round and round Harry new room.
----------------------------------------------
“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley’s asked Harry in amazement.
----------------------------------------------
When His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and Dudley arms over Aunt Petunia and Dudley faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
----------------------------------------------
Aunt Petunia and Dudley could hear Twenty-four letters to Harry still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit Dudley’s round the head for holding they up while Dudley’s tried to pack Dudley’s television, VCR, and computer in Dudley’s sports bag.
----------------------------------------------
By nightfall Dudley’s was howling.
----------------------------------------------
He’d never had such a bad day in Dudley’s life.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s was hungry, Dudley’s’d missed five television programs Dudley’s’d wanted to see, and Dudley’s’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on Dudley’s computer.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’sand Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering...
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Harry ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Harry had just finished when the owner of a gloomy- looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city came over to Dudley and Harry table.
----------------------------------------------
Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” The woman held up a letter so Dudley and Harry could read the green ink address: Mr. H.
----------------------------------------------
“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t Uncle Vernon?” Dudley’s asked His Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s sniveled.
----------------------------------------------
If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley’s to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley’s on the moth-eaten sofa.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight.
----------------------------------------------
The lighted dial of Dudley’s’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the moth-eaten sofa on Dudley’s fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
nine — maybe Harry’d wake Dudley’sup, just to annoy Harry — three ...
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s jerked awake.
----------------------------------------------
“Where’s the cannon?” Dudley’s said stupidly.
----------------------------------------------
strode over to the sofa where Dudley’s sat frozen with fear.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s squeaked and ran to hide behind Dudley’s mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“You are breaking and entering!” “Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said A giant of a man; A giant of a man reached over the back of the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent the gun into a knot as easily as if the gun had been made of rubber, and threw the gun into a corner of the second room.
----------------------------------------------
Nobody said a thing while A giant of a man was working, but as A giant of a man slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley’sfidgeted a little.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything Dudley’s gives you, Dudley’s.” A giant of a man chuckled darkly.
----------------------------------------------
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” Dudley’s passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry Dudley’s had never tasted anything so wonderful, but Dudley’s still couldn’t take His eyes off A giant of a man.
----------------------------------------------
Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, Dudley’s said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” A giant of a man took a gulp of tea and wiped Dudley’s mouth with the back of Dudley’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Call me Hagrid,” Dudley’s said, “everyone does.
----------------------------------------------
He’d spent Him life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if Him was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock Him in Him cupboard?
----------------------------------------------
If Him’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick Him around like a football?
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” Dudley said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t think I can be a wizard.” To Dudley surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
chased by Dudley’s gang, Harry had somehow found Harry out of he, Harry, reach .
----------------------------------------------
and the very last time Dudley had hit Harry, hadn’t Harry got Harry revenge, without even realizing Harry was doing it?
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------
When Dudley turned Dudley back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in Harry trousers.
----------------------------------------------
Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, Uncle Vernon cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind Aunt Petunia and Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that Harry was holding more money than he’d had in Harry whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.
----------------------------------------------
I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle in somehow.” Harry was strongly reminded of even Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find out how to curse even Dudley.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry to do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t speak to Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
Harry cleared Harry throat to let them know Harry was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.
----------------------------------------------
“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled ” Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“Got to have that ruddy tail removed before Dudley goes to Smeltings.” Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep.
----------------------------------------------
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
----------------------------------------------
After all, Harry’d never had any money in Harry life until a month ago, and Harry told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had always been last to be chosen, not because Harry was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made Harry sick.
----------------------------------------------
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL Harry had never believed Harry would meet a boy Harry hated more than Dudley, but that was before Harry met Draco Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...” 
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
House
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursleyas Mr. Dursley left the house.
----------------------------------------------
Trying to pull Mr. Dursley together, Mr. Dursley let Mr. Dursley into the house.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got Young Sirius Black, sir.” “No problems, were there?” “No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got sir — houseout all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls held no sign at a large blond boylived in the house, too.
----------------------------------------------
The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made Harry look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.
----------------------------------------------
“And come back and find The whole house smelled of cabbage in ruins?” His Aunt Petunia snarled.
----------------------------------------------
“I won’t blow up The whole house smelled of cabbage,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.
----------------------------------------------
After lunch another one and Harry went to the reptile house.
----------------------------------------------
the reptile house was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls.
----------------------------------------------
It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was His Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least Harry got to visit the rest of the house.
----------------------------------------------
People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.
----------------------------------------------
Thanksss, amigo.” The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.
----------------------------------------------
But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harrywas talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry.
----------------------------------------------
aunt and uncle in the house.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s’s gang, who visited the house every single day.
----------------------------------------------
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where Harry could see a tiny ray of hope.
----------------------------------------------
You don’t think they’re watching the house?” “Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.
----------------------------------------------
...” “But — ” “I’m not having one in the house, Petunia!
----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
Twenty-four letters to Harry found Twenty-four letters to Harry way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that Twenty-four letters to Harry very confused milkman had handed His Aunt Petunia through the living room window.
----------------------------------------------
After what seemed like hours their reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when letters got back that Harry’d be able to steal one somehow.
----------------------------------------------
— with a person called — came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew Hagrid nose with a sound like a foghorn.
----------------------------------------------
That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders.
----------------------------------------------
“D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave Hagrid anything?” “But if their house was destroyed — ” “their didntheir keep their gold in their house, boy!
----------------------------------------------
“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree.
----------------------------------------------
Know my House my House you be in yet?” “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
----------------------------------------------
“Do either of you know what House you’ll be in?
----------------------------------------------
“Whatever what House I’m in, I hope she’s not in what House,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Stupid spell — George gave it to George , bet George knew it was a dud.” “what House what House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if Mom and Dad put me in Slytherin.” “That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?” “Yeah,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.
----------------------------------------------
House House has House own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards.
----------------------------------------------
While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- breaking will lose House points.
----------------------------------------------
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor.
----------------------------------------------
I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.
----------------------------------------------
“My old House, you know.” “Move along now,” said a sharp voice.
----------------------------------------------
Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let a pointed wizard’s hat in the house.
----------------------------------------------
If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.
----------------------------------------------
“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” Sometimes, Harry noticed, a pointed wizard’s hat shouted out the House at once, but at others the House took a little while to decide.
----------------------------------------------
I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this year?
----------------------------------------------
Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns was head of Gryffindor House, but Professor Binns hadn’t stopped Professor Binns from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycomplained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with Malfoy narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.
----------------------------------------------
“But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about — ” “ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
If Gryffindor won, Gryffindor would move up into second place in the House Championship.
----------------------------------------------
“Just come round my house this summer.
----------------------------------------------
Anyway, maybe my house only shows dead people.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
All my family are dead — let me have another look — ” “You had this mirror to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.” “You’re only holding the House Cup, whatFilch’sinteresting about that?
----------------------------------------------
If they won they next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” Hermione said.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and ’s going to be as long as your house.
----------------------------------------------
In one night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup.
----------------------------------------------
At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the House points the next day thought there ’d been a mistake.
----------------------------------------------
Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on Harry, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside Hagrid house; Hagrid trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and Hagrid was shelling peas into a large bowl.
----------------------------------------------
Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” Harry and Ron went back to the common room.
----------------------------------------------
D’you think D’you’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup?
----------------------------------------------
“I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” Quirrell cursed again.
----------------------------------------------
the Great Hall was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Madam Pomfrey’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.” The din was deafening.
----------------------------------------------
Those who could add up while yelling themselves had tied for the House Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.
----------------------------------------------

*************************************************
Mirror
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, Mr. Dursley watched a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive in Mr. Dursley mirror.
----------------------------------------------
THE MIRROR OF ERISED Christmas was coming.
----------------------------------------------
Harry dashed to the mirror.
----------------------------------------------
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.
----------------------------------------------
panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, wanting to look at Harry but see no reflection again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heart was pounding far more furiously than when One book had screamed — for Harry had seen not only Harry in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Breathing very fast, Harry turned slowly back to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
There Harry was, reflected in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, white and scared- looking, and there, reflected behind Harry, were at least ten others.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling again.
----------------------------------------------
If A woman standing right behind his reflection was really there, Harry’d touch A woman standing right behind his reflection, their reflections were so close together, but Harry felt only air — A woman standing right behind his reflection and the others existed only in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was so close to the mirror now that Harry nose was nearly touching that of Harry reflection.
----------------------------------------------
And slowly, Harrylooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like Harry, other noses like Harry, even a little old man who looked as though Harry had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry Harry was looking at Harry family, for the first time in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.” “I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
“You look odd.” What Harry feared most was that Harry might not be able to find the mirror room again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry dropped the cloak from around Harry shoulders and ran to the mirror.
----------------------------------------------
...” “I can only see you.” “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, Harry couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ronin Harry paisley pajamas.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think this mirror shows the future?” “How can this mirror?
----------------------------------------------
All my family are dead — let me have another look — ” “You had this mirror to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.” “You’re only holding the House Cup, whatFilch’sinteresting about that?
----------------------------------------------
you go ...” “I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.
----------------------------------------------
Harrymust have walked straight past Harry, so desperate to get to the mirror Harry hadn’t noticed Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised Erised like a normal mirror, that is, The happiest man on earth would look into the Mirror of Erised and see The happiest man on earth exactly as The happiest man on earth is.
----------------------------------------------
However, the Mirror of Erised will give us neither knowledge or truth.
----------------------------------------------
Men have wasted away before the Mirror of Erised, entranced by what Men have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what the Mirror of Erised shows is real or even possible.
----------------------------------------------
“the Mirror of Erised will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again.
----------------------------------------------
If you ever do run across the Mirror of Erised, you will now be prepared.
----------------------------------------------
the Mirror of Erised does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.
----------------------------------------------
“You may ask me one more thing, however.” “What do you see when you look in the Mirror of Erised?” “I?
----------------------------------------------
NICHOLAS FLAMBL Dumbledore gently had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays an Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of Dumbledore gently trunk.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wished Harry could forget what Harry’d seen in the Mirror of Erised as easily, but Harry couldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
“Nice to see you haven’t been brooding about that mirror .
----------------------------------------------
I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
It was the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
“the Mirror of Erised is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrellmurmured, tapping Quirrell way around the frame.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrelltalking and stop Quirrell from concentrating on the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the Mirror of Erised to look at the back.
----------------------------------------------
...” Quirrell came back out from behind the Mirror of Erised and stared hungrily into the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had to keep Quirrell from giving Harry whole attention to the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
Should I break the mirror?” Harry’s mind was racing.
----------------------------------------------
So if I look in the mirror, I should see my self finding the mirror — which means I’ll see where the mirror’s hidden!
----------------------------------------------
“What does the mirror do?
----------------------------------------------
How does the mirror work?
----------------------------------------------
“Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.” Harry walked toward Harry.
----------------------------------------------
turban closed turban eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.
----------------------------------------------
“And Sir, there’s one more thing ...” “Just the one?” “How did I get the Stone the Stone out of the mirror?” “Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t think it was an accident “D’you let me find out how the mirror worked.
----------------------------------------------
the mirror’s almost like “D’you thought I had the right to face Lord Voldemort if I could.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Harry
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” “ — yes, five different people son, Harry — ” Mr. Dursley stopped dead.
----------------------------------------------
Potter was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Come to think of it, Potter wasn’t even sure Potter nephew was called Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley wondered whether Mr. Dursley dared tell Mr. Dursley Mr. Dursley’d heard “Harry.” Mr. Dursley decided Mr. Dursley didn’t dare.
----------------------------------------------
Howard, isn’t “Harry?” “Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying Albus Dumbledore tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?” “We can only guess,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?” “I’ve come to bring Harry to Harry aunt and uncle.
----------------------------------------------
“’re the only family Harry has left now.” “You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to Professor McGonagall Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter come and live here!” “It’s the best place for him,” said Albus Dumbledore firmly.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked a letterinside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two.
----------------------------------------------
“Good luck, Harry,” Albus Dumbledore murmured.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter rolled over inside Harry Potter blankets without waking up.
----------------------------------------------
One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was special, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as Mrs. Dursley opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter Aunt Petunia was awake and His Aunt Petunia was His Aunt Petunia shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.
----------------------------------------------
Now!” Harry woke with a start.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heard His Aunt Petunia walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.
----------------------------------------------
Harry rolled onto Harry back and tried to remember the dream Harry had been having.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had a funny feeling Harry’d had the same dream before.
----------------------------------------------
“Nearly,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
And don’t you dare let the bacon burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” Harry groaned.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks.
----------------------------------------------
Harry found a pair under Harry bed and, after pulling a spider off one of a pair, put a pair on.
----------------------------------------------
Harrywas used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of a pair, and that was where Harry slept.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry was dressed Harry went down the hall into the kitchen.
----------------------------------------------
Exactly why Dudley’s wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley’s was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but Dudley’s couldn’t often catch Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t look it, but Harry was very fast.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for Harry age.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked even smaller and skinnier than Harry really was because all Harry had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley’s was about four times bigger than Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley’s had punched Harry on the nose.
----------------------------------------------
The only thing Harry liked about Harry own appearance was a very thin scar on Harry forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had had it as long as Harry could remember, and the first question Harry could ever remember asking His Aunt Petunia was how Harry had gotten it.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.
----------------------------------------------
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of Uncle Vernon newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.
----------------------------------------------
Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in Harry class put together, but it made no difference, Harry hair simply grew that way — all over the place.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley’s arrived in the kitchen with his mother.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petuniaoften said that Dudley’s looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley’s looked like a pig in a wig.
----------------------------------------------
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down Dudley bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley’s turned the table over.
----------------------------------------------
At that moment the telephone rang and His Aunt Petuniawent to answer the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley’s unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.
----------------------------------------------
his money’s can’t take Atta boy, Dudley!”.” his money’s jerked his money’s head in Harry’s direction.
----------------------------------------------
Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hated it there.
----------------------------------------------
The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made Harry look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.
----------------------------------------------
“Now what?” said His Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry Harry as though Harry’d planned this.
----------------------------------------------
Harry knew Harry ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken Mrs. Figg leg, but it wasn’t easy when Mrs. Figg reminded Mrs. Figg it would be a whole year before Mrs. Figg had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t be silly, Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon hates a large blond boy.” the Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though Harry wasn’t there — or rather, as though Harry was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.
----------------------------------------------
“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what Harry wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer) .
----------------------------------------------
“I won’t blow up The whole house smelled of cabbage,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose we could take Harry to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, "...
----------------------------------------------
and leave Harry in the car.
----------------------------------------------
...” “That cars new, Harry’s not sitting in it alone.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s always sp- spoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with Dudley’s .
----------------------------------------------
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe Dudley’s luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley’s, on the way to the zoo for the first time in Dudley’s life.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with Dudley’s, but before His aunt and uncle’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you,” Uncle Vernon had said, putting Uncle Vernon large purple face right up close to his money’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and The problem was just no good telling the Dursleys Harry didn’t make the Dursleys happen.
----------------------------------------------
Once, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair so short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had laughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was already laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped glasses.
----------------------------------------------
The harder His Aunt Petunia tried to pull The over His Aunt Petunia head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to His Aunt Petunia great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.
----------------------------------------------
On the other hand, Harry’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s gang had been chasing Harry as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there Harry was sitting on the chimney.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys had received a very angry letter from his money’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.
----------------------------------------------
Harry supposed that the wind must have caught Harry in mid-jump.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harrywere just a few of Uncle Vernon favorite subjects.
----------------------------------------------
“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
----------------------------------------------
“I know they don’t,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“It was only a dream.” But Harry wished Harry hadn’t said anything.
----------------------------------------------
If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than Harry asking questions, it was Harry talking about anything acting in a way the Dursleys shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think Harry might get dangerous ideas.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what Harry wanted before they could hurry Harry away, they bought Harry a cheap lemon ice pop.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking It as they watched a gorilla scratching It head who looked remarkably like Dudley’s, except that it wasn’t blond.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had the best morning Harry’d had in a long time.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley’s and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on the animals favorite hobby of hitting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
the animals ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley’s had a tantrum because Dudley’s knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought Dudley’s another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt, afterward, that Harry should have known it was all too good to last.
----------------------------------------------
After lunch another one and Harry went to the reptile house.
----------------------------------------------
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the largest snake in the place.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if the largest snake in the place had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long.
----------------------------------------------
It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was His Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least Harry got to visit the rest of the house.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked back at the largest snake in the place and winked, too.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.” “I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though Harry wasn’t sure the largest snake in the place could hear Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.
----------------------------------------------
Harry peered at the glass.
----------------------------------------------
“Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed The boa constrictor at a little sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” As the largest snake in the place shook the largest snake in the place head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of a deafening shout behind Harry jump.
----------------------------------------------
“Out of the way, you,” Dudley’s said, punching Harry in the ribs.
----------------------------------------------
Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished.
----------------------------------------------
As the largest snake in the place slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, BrazilBrazil, here I come.
----------------------------------------------
As far as Harry had seen, the largest snake in the place hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at Piers and Dudley heels as the largest snake in the place passed, but by the time Piers and Dudley were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley’s was telling Piers and Dudley how the largest snake in the place had nearly bitten off Dudley’s leg, while Piers was swearing the largest snake in the place had tried to squeeze Dudley’s to death.
----------------------------------------------
But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harrywas talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry lay in — cupboard much later, wishing Harry had a watch.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know what time it was and Harry couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.
----------------------------------------------
Until they were, Harry couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as Harry could remember, ever since Harry’d been a baby and Harry parents had died in that car crash.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died.
----------------------------------------------
Sometimes, when Harry strained Harry memory during long hours in Harry cupboard, Harry came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on Harry forehead.
----------------------------------------------
This, Harry supposed, was that car crash, though Harry couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t remember his parents at all.
----------------------------------------------
Harry aunt and uncle never spoke about the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
aunt and uncle, and of course Harry was forbidden to ask questions.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take Harry away, but it had never happened; the Dursleyswere Harry only family.
----------------------------------------------
Yet sometimes Harry thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know Harry.
----------------------------------------------
After asking Harry furiously if Harry knew A tiny man in a violet top hat, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.
----------------------------------------------
A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at Harry once on a bus.
----------------------------------------------
The weirdest thing about all these people was the way all these people seemed to vanish Harry Harry tried to get a closer look.
----------------------------------------------
At school, Harry had no one.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor longest-ever punishment.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s’s gang, who visited the house every single day.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.
----------------------------------------------
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where Harry could see a tiny ray of hope.
----------------------------------------------
When September came Harry would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in Harry life, Harry wouldn’t be with Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school.
----------------------------------------------
“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” Dudley’s told Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Want to come upstairs and practice?” “No, thanks,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
One day in July, His Aunt Petunia took Dudley’s to London to buy His Aunt Petunia Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s.
----------------------------------------------
old Mrs. Figg let Harry watch television and gave Harry a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though old Mrs. Figg’d had ’d for several years.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t trust the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
k k k There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast.
----------------------------------------------
Harry went to have a look.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked in the bowl again.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh,” Harry said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” “Don’t be stupid,” snapped His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” Harry seriously doubted this, but thought this best not to argue.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat down at the table and tried not to think about how Harry was going to look on Harry first day at Stonewall High — like Harry was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.
----------------------------------------------
“Make Harry get it.” “Get the mail, Harry.” “Make Dudley’s get it.” “Poke Dudley’s with your Smelting stick, Dudley’s.” Harry dodged your Smelting stick, Dudley and went to get the mail.
----------------------------------------------
Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry picked a bill up and stared at a bill, Harry heart twanging like a giant elastic band.
----------------------------------------------
No one, ever, in Harry whole life, had written to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had no friends, no other relatives — Harry didn’t belong to the library, so Harry’d never even got rude notes asking for books back.
----------------------------------------------
“What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” Harry chuckled at Harry own joke.
----------------------------------------------
Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at a letter.
----------------------------------------------
Harry handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open The envelope.
----------------------------------------------
“Dad, Mrs. Figg’s got something!” Harry was on the point of unfolding Harry letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of Harry hand by Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s mine\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
----------------------------------------------
Harry face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights.
----------------------------------------------
Oh my goodness — Vernon!” They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley’s were still in the room.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to read a letter,” said Harry furiously, “as a letter’s mine.” “Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside a letter envelope.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t move.
----------------------------------------------
“I WANT MY LETTER!” Harry shouted.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley’s won, so Harry, Harry glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on Harry stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon,” His Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where Harry sleeps?
----------------------------------------------
Tell they us don’t want — ” Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.
----------------------------------------------
“No,” Harry said finally.
----------------------------------------------
Didn’t us swear when us took — ” in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?” That evening when — ” got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something — ” ’d never done before; ’dvisited Harry in — ” cupboard.
----------------------------------------------
“Where’s a letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door.
----------------------------------------------
“I have burned No one.” “It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “It had my cupboard on It.” “SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard.
----------------------------------------------
we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s’s second bedroom.” “Why?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything Harry owned from this cupboard to this room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat down on the bed and stared around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed.
----------------------------------------------
Yesterday Harry’d have given anything to be up here.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was thinking about this time Yesterday and bitterly wishing Harry’d opened the letter in the hall.
----------------------------------------------
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley’s go and get it.
----------------------------------------------
Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, Privet Drive — ’ ” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in Harry hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” Harry wheezed at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s — go — just go.” Harry walked round and round Harry new room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently.
----------------------------------------------
” Harry leapt into the air; Harry’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\ Lights clicked on upstairs and to Harry horror Harryrealized that the big, squashy something had been Harry uncle’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what Harry’d been trying to do.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told Harry to go and make a cup of tea.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time Harry got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.
----------------------------------------------
“I want — ” Harry began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing three letters before Uncle Vernon eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Twenty-four letters to Harry found Twenty-four letters to Harry way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that Twenty-four letters to Harry very confused milkman had handed His Aunt Petunia through the living room window.
----------------------------------------------
“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley’s asked Harry in amazement.
----------------------------------------------
The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one — “Out!
----------------------------------------------
OUT!Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw Harry into the hall.
----------------------------------------------
Aunt Petunia and Dudley could hear Twenty-four letters to Harry still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’sand Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering...
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Harry ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Harry had just finished when the owner of a gloomy- looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city came over to Dudley and Harry table.
----------------------------------------------
Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” The woman held up a letter so Dudley and Harry could read the green ink address: Mr. H.
----------------------------------------------
Potter Room Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for a letter but Uncle Vernonknocked Uncle Vernon hand out of the way.
----------------------------------------------
This reminded Harry of something.
----------------------------------------------
If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley’s to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday.
----------------------------------------------
Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer Harry up at all.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor Harry could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t sleep.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, Harry stomach rumbling with hunger.
----------------------------------------------
The lighted dial of Dudley’s’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the moth-eaten sofa on Dudley’s fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
Harry lay and watched Harry birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heard something creak outside.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although Harry might be warmer if the roof did.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when letters got back that Harry’d be able to steal one somehow.
----------------------------------------------
nine — maybe Harry’d wake Dudley’sup, just to annoy Harry — three ...
----------------------------------------------
The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ here’s Harry!” said A giant of a man.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
----------------------------------------------
“Anyway Harry,” said A giant of a man, turning Harry back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to Yeh.
----------------------------------------------
Harry opened a slightly squashed box with trembling fingers.
----------------------------------------------
Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Harry written on a slightly squashed box in green icing.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked up at A giant of a man.
----------------------------------------------
Harry meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to Harry mouth, and what Harry said instead was, “Who are you?” A giant of a man chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” Harry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
----------------------------------------------
“What about that tea then, eh?” Harry said, rubbing Harry hands together.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d not say no ter summat stronger if got , mind.” Harry eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in His eyes and Harry snorted.
----------------------------------------------
Harry bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what Harry was doing but when Harry drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there.
----------------------------------------------
a roaring fire filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over Harry as though Harry’d sunk into a hot bath.
----------------------------------------------
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” Dudley’s passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry Dudley’s had never tasted anything so wonderful, but Dudley’s still couldn’t take His eyes off A giant of a man.
----------------------------------------------
An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” “Er — no,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.
----------------------------------------------
Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?” “All what?” asked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
— knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?” Harry thought this was going a bit far.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been to school, after all, and Harry marks weren’t bad.
----------------------------------------------
“I know some things,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“I can, you know, do math and stuff.” But Hagrid simply waved Harry hand and said, “About our world, I mean.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagridstared wildly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“But Harry must know about yer mom and dad,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran Hagridfingers through Yeh hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
----------------------------------------------
An’ you’ve kept fer him from Dumbledore all these years?” “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry — yer a wizard.” There was silence inside the hut.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.
----------------------------------------------
An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time Yeh read yer letter.” Harry stretched out Harry hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
Taking Harry to buy Harry things tomorrow.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed his mouthquickly.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s not going,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“A what?” said Harry, interested.
----------------------------------------------
Wizard indeed!” “You knew?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
What happened?” Harry asked urgently.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked suddenly anxious.
----------------------------------------------
“I never expected this,” Harry said, in a low, worried voice.
----------------------------------------------
Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell Yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” ta threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.
----------------------------------------------
No one does.” “Why not?” “Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared.
----------------------------------------------
“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.
----------------------------------------------
Dark days, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
No one ever lived after No one decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’ No one’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.” Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped; Harry had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back Harry courage.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.
----------------------------------------------
“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You- Know-Who?” “Good question, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Same night Harry tried ter kill you.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d ’d go?
----------------------------------------------
’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
There was somethin’ goin’ on that night Don hadn’t counted on — / dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped Don, all right.” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in Hagrid eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.
----------------------------------------------
Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?” Harry looked into the fire.
----------------------------------------------
Now Harry came to think about it .
----------------------------------------------
every odd thing that had ever made Harry aunt and uncle furious with Harry had happened when Harry, Harry, had been upset or angry ...
----------------------------------------------
chased by Dudley’s gang, Harry had somehow found Harry out of he, Harry, reach .
----------------------------------------------
dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, Harry’d managed to make it grow back .
----------------------------------------------
and the very last time Dudley had hit Harry, hadn’t Harry got Harry revenge, without even realizing Harry was doing it?
----------------------------------------------
Hadn’t Harry set a boa constrictor on Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.
----------------------------------------------
When Dudley turned Dudley back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in Harry trousers.
----------------------------------------------
Meant ter turn Hagrid into a pig, but I suppose Hagrid was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” Hagrid cast a sideways look at Harry under Hagrid bushy eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ” “Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.” took off and threw his coat to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.” Harry Harry woke early the next morning.
----------------------------------------------
Although Harrycould tell it was daylight, Harry kept his eyes shut tight.
----------------------------------------------
“It was a dream,” Harry told Harry firmly.
----------------------------------------------
And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harrythought, Harry heart sinking.
----------------------------------------------
But Harry still didn’t open his eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Tap“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” Harry sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry scrambled to Harry feet, so happy Harry felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry went straight to the window and jerked the window open.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t do that.” Harry tried to wave The owl out of the way, but The owlsnapped The owl fiercely at Harry and carried on savaging Hagrid ’s coat.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid ’s!” said Harry loudly.
----------------------------------------------
“What?” “Harry wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper.
----------------------------------------------
“Give Harry five Knuts,” said Hagrid ’s sleepily.
----------------------------------------------
“Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.” Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and The owlheld out Harry leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to the money.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry flew off through the open window.
----------------------------------------------
“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” Harry was turning over five little bronze coins and looking at five little bronze coins.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had just thought of something that made Harry feel as though the happy balloon inside Harry had got a puncture.
----------------------------------------------
“Urn — Hagrid?” “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on Harry huge boots.
----------------------------------------------
Run by goblins.” Harry dropped the bit of sausage Harry was holding.
----------------------------------------------
Never mess with goblins, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Come on, then.” Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock.
----------------------------------------------
“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.
----------------------------------------------
Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got ter .” They settled down in The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine Harry flying.
----------------------------------------------
“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of Harry sideways looks.
----------------------------------------------
“If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.
----------------------------------------------
Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read Harry newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while people did this, but it was very difficult, Harry’d never had so many questions in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before Harry could stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic solutions to Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” At this moment The boat Uncle Vernon had hired bumped gently into the harbor wall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t blame they.
----------------------------------------------
Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, Harry kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as Muggle called it, gave the bills to Harry so Muggle could buy Hagrid, who didn’t tickets.
----------------------------------------------
“Still got yer letter, Harry?” Hagrid asked as Hagrid counted stitches.
----------------------------------------------
Harry took the parchment envelope out of Harry pocket.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” Harry unfolded a second piece of paper Harry hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: .
----------------------------------------------
One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade ) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT wand cauldron (pewter, standard size ) set glass or crystal phials telescope set brass scales Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS “Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never been to London before.
----------------------------------------------
Although Hagrid seemed to know where Harry was going, Harry was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” Harry said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was so huge that Hagrid parted the crowd easily; Harry Harry had to do was keep close behind Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if could sell you a magic wand.
----------------------------------------------
If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, Harry hadmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told Harry so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
If Hagrid hadn’t pointed Hagrid hadn’t out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed Hagrid hadn’t was there.
----------------------------------------------
In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only Harry and Hagrid could see it.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could mention this, Hagrid had steered Harry inside.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; waved and smiled at Hagrid, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?” “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping Hagrid great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.
----------------------------------------------
“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be — ?” The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
----------------------------------------------
what an honor.” Harry hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry Harry and seized Harry hand, tears in Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome back, Harry Potter ..., welcome back.” Harry didn’t know what to say.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone was looking at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found Harry shaking hands with everyone in The Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “So proud, Harry Potter ..., I’m just so proud.” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in Harry excitement.
----------------------------------------------
“You bowed to me once in a shop.” “Harry remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
But the others wouldn’t let “Professor Quirrell keep Harry to “Professor Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Come on, Harry.” Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s head was swimming.
----------------------------------------------
“Right, stand back, Harry.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind tapped the wall above the trash can three times with the point of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind umbrella.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind grinned at Harry’s amazement.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked quickly over Harry shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.” Harry wished Harry had about eight more eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned Harry head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside they, the people doing they shopping.
----------------------------------------------
Several boys of about Harry age had Several boys of about Harry’s age noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.
----------------------------------------------
“Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.
----------------------------------------------
The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, Hagrid and Harry followed Griphook!” toward one of the doors leading off a vast marble hall.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.
----------------------------------------------
More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” Griphook!” held the door open for he and Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who had expected more marble were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches.
----------------------------------------------
Griphook!” whistled and a small cart came hurtling up little railway tracks on the floor toward Harry, who had expected more marble.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who had expected more marble climbed in Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.
----------------------------------------------
At first Harry, who had expected more marble just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but Harry kept them wide open.
----------------------------------------------
Once, Harry thought Harry saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — them plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
----------------------------------------------
“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of a small cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in Stalagmite’s,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as A lot of green smoke cleared, Harry gasped.
----------------------------------------------
How often had they complained how much Harry cost they to keep?
----------------------------------------------
And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to Harry, buried deep under London.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of Hagrid into a bag.
----------------------------------------------
“The gold ones are Galleons,” Harry explained.
----------------------------------------------
Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for Harry.” Harry turned to Griphook!” .
----------------------------------------------
They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled Harry back by the scruff of Harry neck.
----------------------------------------------
“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.
----------------------------------------------
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and Harry leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first Harry thought it was empty.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry longed to know what a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor was, but knew better than to ask.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know where to run first now that Harry had a bag full of money.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that Harry was holding more money than he’d had in Harry whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.
----------------------------------------------
“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron?
----------------------------------------------
I hate them Gringotts carts.” Harry did still look a bit sick, so Harryentered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.
----------------------------------------------
“Hogwarts, dear?” Madam Malkin’s said, when Harry started to speak.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Malkin’s stood Harry on a stool next to Madam Malkin’s, slipped a long robe over Madam Malkin’s head, and began to pin a long robe to the right length.
----------------------------------------------
“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” “Yes,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle in somehow.” Harry was strongly reminded of even Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
“No,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Play Quidditch at all?” “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.
----------------------------------------------
Know my House my House you be in yet?” “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing Harry could say something a bit more interesting.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show Hagrid couldn’t come in.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something a boy with a pale didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
a boy with a pale’s a sort of servant, isn’t a boy with a pale?” “a boy with a pale’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I heard a boy with a pale’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then a boy with a pale gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to a boy with a pale bed.” “I think Hagrid’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
----------------------------------------------
Where are your parents?” “your parents’re dead,” said Harry shortly.
----------------------------------------------
What’s your surname, anyway?” But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin’s said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was rather quiet as Harry ate the ice cream Hagridhad bought Harry (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing,” Harry lied.
----------------------------------------------
Harry cheered up a bit when Harry found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.
----------------------------------------------
When They had left the shop, Harry said, “Hagrid, whatStalagmite’s Quidditch?” “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little Harry know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!” “Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.
----------------------------------------------
“ — and Harry said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in — ” “Yer not from a Muggle family.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ” “I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.
----------------------------------------------
bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in postage stamps at all.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before Harry get ter that level.” Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.
----------------------------------------------
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
----------------------------------------------
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.
----------------------------------------------
“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” Harry felt Harry go red.
----------------------------------------------
Tell Harry what, I’ll get yer animal.
----------------------------------------------
Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with Harry head under Harry wing.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t stop stammering Harry thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and Harry gotta have the best wand.” A magic wand .
----------------------------------------------
this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt strangely as though Harry had entered a very strict library; Harry swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to Harry and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
For some reason, the back of Harry neck prickled.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped.
----------------------------------------------
“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah yes,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question.
----------------------------------------------
her first wand.” Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wished Mr. Ollivander would blink.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see Harry reflected in those misty eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“And that’s where ...” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.
----------------------------------------------
...” Yew shook Yew head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed Harry gripped Harry pink umbrella very tightly as Harry spoke.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, now — Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Which is your wand arm?” “Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.” Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between Harry nostrils, was doing this on this own.
----------------------------------------------
Just take it and give it a wave.” Harry took wand and (feeling foolish) waved wand around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched wand out of Mr. Ollivander hand almost at once.
----------------------------------------------
Try — ” Harry tried — but Harry had hardly raised wandwhen wand, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
----------------------------------------------
Go on, go on, try it out.” Harry tried.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for.
----------------------------------------------
Not to worry, well find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” Harry took wand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt a sudden warmth in Harry fingers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry raised wand above Harry head, brought wand swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.
----------------------------------------------
how very curious ...” Mr. Ollivander put Harry’s wand back into Harry’s box and wrapped its box in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious .
----------------------------------------------
curious “Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with Mr. Ollivander pale stare.
----------------------------------------------
It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for wand when wand brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” Harry swallowed.
----------------------------------------------
After all, He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.” Harry shivered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wasn’t sure Harry liked Mr. Ollivander too much.
----------------------------------------------
Harry paid seven gold Galleons for Harry wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed seven gold Galleons from Mr. Ollivander shop.
----------------------------------------------
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harryand Hagrid made Harry and Hagrid way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; Harry didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at they on the Underground, laden as much people were with all much people funny- shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap.
----------------------------------------------
Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where much people were when Hagrid tapped Harry on the shoulder.
----------------------------------------------
“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
Harry bought Harry a hamburger and much people sat down on plastic seats to eat much people.
----------------------------------------------
Harry kept looking around.
----------------------------------------------
“You all right, Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Harry wasn’t sure Harry could explain.
----------------------------------------------
He’d just had the best birthday of Harry life — and yet — Harry chewed a hamburger, trying to find the words.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone thinks I’m special,” Harry said at last.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ you worry, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.” Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take Harry back to the Dursleys, then handed Harry an envelope.
----------------------------------------------
See yeh soon, Harry.” the train that would take him back to the Dursleys pulled out of Paddington station.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until Harry was out of sight; Harry rose in Harry seat and pressed Harry nose against the window, but Harry blinked and Hagrid had gone.
----------------------------------------------
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun.
----------------------------------------------
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry to do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t speak to Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty.
----------------------------------------------
Harry kept to the same room, with Harry new owl for company.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had decided to call her Hedwig, a name Harry had found in A History of Magic.
----------------------------------------------
Harry school books were very interesting.
----------------------------------------------
Harry lay on Harry bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as Hedwig pleased.
----------------------------------------------
Every night before Harry went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper Harry had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.
----------------------------------------------
On the last day of August Harry thought Harry’d better speak to Harry aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so Harry went down to the living room where his aunt and uncle were watching a quiz show on television.
----------------------------------------------
Harry cleared Harry throat to let them know Harry was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.
----------------------------------------------
Harry supposed that meant yes.
----------------------------------------------
“Thank you.” Harry was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.
----------------------------------------------
Magic carpets all got punctures, have Magic carpets all?” Harry didn’t say anything.
----------------------------------------------
“Where is this school, anyway?” “I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled Hagrid had given Harry out of Harry pocket.
----------------------------------------------
“I just take the train from platform nine and three- quarters at eleven o’clock,” Harry read.
----------------------------------------------
we’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” “Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.
----------------------------------------------
“Got to have that ruddy tail removed before Dudley goes to Smeltings.” Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got up and pulled on Harry jeans because Harry didn’t want to walk into Paddington station in Harry wizard’s robes — Harry’d change on the train.
----------------------------------------------
Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.
----------------------------------------------
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled Harry’s trunk into the station for Harry’s.
----------------------------------------------
Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but Your platform don’t seem to have built Your platform yet, do Your platform?” Harry was quite right, of course.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s mouth went rather dry.
----------------------------------------------
What on earth was Harry going to do?
----------------------------------------------
Harry was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters.
----------------------------------------------
a passing guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell Harry what part of the country it was in, Harry started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose.
----------------------------------------------
Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but a passing guard said there wasn’t one.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was now trying hard not to panic.
----------------------------------------------
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, Harry had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and Harry had no idea how to do it; Harry was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk Harry could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell Harry something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wondered if Harry should get out Harry wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.
----------------------------------------------
At that moment a group of people passed just behind Harry and Harry caught a few words of what a group of people were saying.
----------------------------------------------
“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” Harry swung round.
----------------------------------------------
Each of a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of Harry — and they had an owl.
----------------------------------------------
Heart hammering, Harry pushed Harry cart after they.
----------------------------------------------
they stopped and so did Harry, just near enough to hear what they were saying.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched, careful not to blink in case Harry missed case — but just as the oldest boyreached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of Harry and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the oldest boy had vanished.
----------------------------------------------
“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“The thing is — The thing is, I don’t know how to — ” “How to get onto the platform?” the plump woman said kindly, and Harry nodded.
----------------------------------------------
Go on, go now before Ron.” “Er — okay,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked more quickly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was going to smash right into the barrier and then Harry’d be in trouble — leaning forward on Harry cart, Ron broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — Harry wouldn’t be able to stop — his cart was out of control — Ron was a foot away — Ron closed Ron eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked behind Harry and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- Quarters on it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had done it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed Harry cart off down a platform packed with people in search of an empty seat.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” “Oh, Neville,” Harry heard the old woman sigh.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pressed on through a small crowd until Harry found an empty compartment near the end of the train.
----------------------------------------------
Harry put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave Harry trunk toward the train door.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice Harry dropped it painfully on Harry foot.
----------------------------------------------
“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins Harry’d followed through the barrier.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, please,” Harry panted.
----------------------------------------------
C’mere and help!” With the red-haired twins ’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of an empty compartment near the end of the train.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing Harry sweaty hair out of Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s that?” said one of the red-haired twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s lightning scar.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you — ?” “Harry is,” said the other twin.
----------------------------------------------
“Aren’t you?” Harry added to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“What?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“ Harry Potter,” chorused the red-haired twins .
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, Harry,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I mean, yes, I am.” The two boys gawked at Harry, and Harry felt Harry turning red.
----------------------------------------------
Then, to Harry relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door.
----------------------------------------------
Are you there?” “Coming, a small girl.” With a last look at Harry, the red-haired twins hopped off the train.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, Harry could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what the red-haired twins were saying.
----------------------------------------------
The youngest boy had already changed into The youngest boy billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on Harry chest with the letter P on it.
----------------------------------------------
Guess who we just met on the train?” Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see Harry looking.
----------------------------------------------
Know who black-haired boy who was near us in is?” “Who?” “ Harry Potted” Harry heard the little girl’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until the train gathered too much speed, then the boys’ mother fell back and waved.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched the girl and the boys’ mother mother disappear as the train rounded the corner.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt a great leap of excitement.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know what Harry was going to — but He had to be better than what Harry was leaving behind.
----------------------------------------------
“Everywhere else is full.” Harry shook Harry head and the youngest redheaded boy sat down.
----------------------------------------------
Harry glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending the youngest redheaded boy hadn’t looked.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry still had a black mark on Harry nose.
----------------------------------------------
Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce we?
----------------------------------------------
See you later, then.” “Bye,” said Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.
----------------------------------------------
Harry nodded.
----------------------------------------------
“And have you really got — you know ...” Ron pointed at Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled back Harry bangs to show the lightning scar.
----------------------------------------------
“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
Ron sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though Ron had suddenly realized what Ron was doing, Ron looked quickly out of the window again.
----------------------------------------------
“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl.
----------------------------------------------
After all, Harry’d never had any money in Harry life until a month ago, and Harry told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
----------------------------------------------
“What?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d have thought you, of all people — ” “I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to Harry feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and Ron muttered that Ron’d brought sandwiches.
----------------------------------------------
Harry went out into the corridor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that Harry had pockets rattling with gold and silver Harry was ready to buy Mars Bars as Harry could carry — but a smiling, dimpled woman didn’t have Mars Bars.
----------------------------------------------
What a smiling, dimpled woman did have were Now Percy’s a prefect Every Flavor Beans, Bertie Bott’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
Not wanting to miss anything, Harry got some of everything and paid a smiling, dimpled woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
----------------------------------------------
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped the compartment onto an empty seat.
----------------------------------------------
“Hungry, are you?” “Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.
----------------------------------------------
Ron pulled one of four sandwiches apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t like corned beef.” “Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty.
----------------------------------------------
“She hasn’t got much time,” Ron added quickly, “you know, with five of us.” “Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with.
----------------------------------------------
it was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
----------------------------------------------
“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
----------------------------------------------
“They’re not really frogs, are They?” Harry was starting to feel that nothing would surprise Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.” Harry unwrapped Harry Chocolate Frog and picked up the card.
----------------------------------------------
“So this is Albus Dumbledore!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry astonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
“Help yourself,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Weird).” Harry stared as Albus Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on Harry card and gave Harry a small smile.
----------------------------------------------
Soon Harry had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
----------------------------------------------
“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.
----------------------------------------------
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in.
----------------------------------------------
keeps getting away from !” “Hell turn up,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by Harry stunned face that Harry hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” “Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.
----------------------------------------------
“Stupid spell — George gave it to George , bet George knew it was a dud.” “what House what House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off Houses.
----------------------------------------------
“So what do your oldest brothers do now that your oldest brothers’ve left, anyway?” Harry was wondering what a wizard did once Harry’d finished school.
----------------------------------------------
ItNow Percy’s a prefect been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.” Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” Harry turned this news over in Harry mind.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know- Who was mentioned.
----------------------------------------------
Harry supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but this had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.
----------------------------------------------
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop.
----------------------------------------------
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
“Three boys’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment.
----------------------------------------------
So all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment’s you, is all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment?” “Yes,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.
----------------------------------------------
My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.” My father turned back to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” Both Harry and Ron stood up.
----------------------------------------------
“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than Harry felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than Harry or Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I think RonNow Percy’s a prefect been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve met Draco Malfoy before?” Harry explained about — Crabbe and Malfoy meeting in Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve heard of Harry family,” said Ron darkly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry peered out of the window.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky.
----------------------------------------------
Please leave your luggage on The train, The train will be taken to the school separately.” Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, Ron saw, looked pale under Ron freckles.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shivered in the cold night air.
----------------------------------------------
Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years!
----------------------------------------------
All right there, Harry?” Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
----------------------------------------------
It was so dark on either side of ” Slipping and stumbling that Harry thought there must be thick trees there.
----------------------------------------------
Neville, the boy who kept losing Harry Potter toad, sniffed once or twice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were followed into Harry and Ron boat by Neville and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts crowded in, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry nervously tried to flatten Harry hair.
----------------------------------------------
Harry swallowed.
----------------------------------------------
Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think Fred was joking.” Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried hard not to listen to No one.
----------------------------------------------
He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when Harry’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that Harry’d somehow turned Harry teachers wig blue.
----------------------------------------------
Harry kept Harry eyes fixed on the door.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place.
----------------------------------------------
Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heard Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside.
----------------------------------------------
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of a rabbit, Harrythought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the Great Hall was now staring at a pointed wizard’s hat, Harry stared at a pointed wizard’s hat, too.
----------------------------------------------
A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and a pointed wizard’s hat began to sing: “Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat Harry if you can find A smarter hat than Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll kill Fred, Fred was going on about wrestling a troll.” Harry smiled weakly.
----------------------------------------------
a pointed wizard’s hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of a pointed wizard’s hat at the moment.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw the ghost of My dear Friar waving merrily at her.
----------------------------------------------
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see “Charlie’s in Romania twin brothers catcalling.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all Harry’d heard about Slytherin, but Harry thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was starting to feel definitely sick now.
----------------------------------------------
Harry remembered being picked for teams during gym at Harry old school.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had always been last to be chosen, not because Harry was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” Sometimes, Harry noticed, a pointed wizard’s hat shouted out the House at once, but at others the House took a little while to decide.
----------------------------------------------
“Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before a pointed wizard’s hat declared him a Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous.
----------------------------------------------
What if Harry wasn’t chosen at all?
----------------------------------------------
What if Harry just sat there with the hat over Harry eyes for ages, until Professor jerked it off Harry head and said there had obviously been a mistake and Harry’d better get back on the train?
----------------------------------------------
, and then, at last — “Potter, Harry!” As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.
----------------------------------------------
“ Potter , did Anne” say?” “ “ Potter?” The last thing Harry saw before a pointed wizard’s hat dropped over Harry eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Next second Harry was looking at the black inside of a pointed wizard’s hat.
----------------------------------------------
Harry waited.
----------------------------------------------
“Hmm,” said a small voice in Harry ear.
----------------------------------------------
So where shall I put you?” Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” Harry heard a pointed wizard’s hat shout the last word to the whole hall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry took off a pointed wizard’s hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, Harry hardly noticed that Harry was getting the loudest cheer yet.
----------------------------------------------
Percy the Prefect got up and shook Harry hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Harry Potter!
----------------------------------------------
We got Harry Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff Harry’d seen earlier.
----------------------------------------------
the ghost in the ruff patted the ghost in the ruff arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling the ghost in the ruff ’d just plunged his arm into a bucket of ice-cold water.
----------------------------------------------
Harry grinned back.
----------------------------------------------
Harry recognized Albus Dumbledore at once from the card Albus Dumbledore’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train.
----------------------------------------------
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
----------------------------------------------
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry crossed Harry fingers under the table and a second later a pointed wizard’s hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into a large gold chair next to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked down at Harry empty gold plate.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had only just realized how hungry Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.
----------------------------------------------
“Is Harry — a bit mad?” Harry asked Percy uncertainly.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s a genius!
----------------------------------------------
But Harry is a bit mad, yes.
----------------------------------------------
Potatoes, Harry?” Harry’s mouth fell open.
----------------------------------------------
The dishes in front of Harry were now piled with food.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never seen so many things Harry liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
----------------------------------------------
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but The Dursleys’d never been allowed to eat as much as The Dursleys liked.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made Harry sick.
----------------------------------------------
Harry piled Harry plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.
----------------------------------------------
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up Harry steak.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t think I’ve introduced Harry?
----------------------------------------------
The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
----------------------------------------------
“How did Harry get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry helped Harry to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.
----------------------------------------------
— all the way down the garden and into the road were all Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again.
----------------------------------------------
a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skinlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.” Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at Snape again.
----------------------------------------------
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.” Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry laughed, but the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because Percy was so tired and full of food.
----------------------------------------------
the people in the portraits along the corridors climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging the people in the portraits along the corridors feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther the people in the portraits along the corridors had to go when the people in the portraits along the corridors came to a sudden halt.
----------------------------------------------
At the top of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
----------------------------------------------
Ron’s chewing my sheets.” Harry was going to ask Ron if Ron’d had any of the treacle tart, but Harry fell asleep almost at once.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because Harry had a very strange dream.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
Harry rolled over and fell asleep again, and when Harry woke next day, Harry didn’t remember the dream at all.
----------------------------------------------
THE POTIONS MASTER “There, look.” “Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see Harry face?” “Did you see Harry scar?” Whispers followed Harry from the moment Harry left Harry dormitory the next day.
----------------------------------------------
People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at Harry, or doubled back to pass Harry in the corridors again, staring.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wished People lining up outside classrooms wouldn’t, because Harry was trying to concentrate on finding Harry way to classes.
----------------------------------------------
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of Harry on Harry and Ron very first morning.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch found Harry and Ron trying to force Harry and Ron way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch wouldn’t believe Harry and Ron were lost, was sure Harry and Ron were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock Harry and Ron in the dungeons when Harry and Ron were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving his wand and saying a few funny words.
----------------------------------------------
At the start of their first class his took the roll call, and when his reached Harry’s name his gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been quite right to think Professor Binns wasn’t a teacher to cross.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was very relieved to find out that Harry wasn’t miles behind everyone else.
----------------------------------------------
Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like Harry, hadn’t had any idea that Lots of people were witches and wizards.
----------------------------------------------
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron finally managed to find Harry and Ron way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
----------------------------------------------
“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as Ron poured sugar on Ron porridge.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had gotten used to this by now, but the mail had given Harry a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until about a hundred owls saw about a hundred owls owners, and dropping letters and packages onto about a hundred owls laps.
----------------------------------------------
Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far.
----------------------------------------------
Hedwig sometimes flew in to nibble Harry ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls.
----------------------------------------------
This morning, however, She fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate.
----------------------------------------------
Harrytore Harry’s plate open at once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
----------------------------------------------
Harry Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
----------------------------------------------
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to Harry so far.
----------------------------------------------
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
By the end of the first Potions lesson, Harry knew Harry’d been wrong.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape didn’t dislike Harry — Professor Snape hated Harry —.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, Professor Snape paused at Harry’s name.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, yes,” Professor Snape said softly, “Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter!” said Professor Snape suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Harryglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as Harry was; Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it would go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, “Harry Potter?” Harry forced Harry to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
----------------------------------------------
“For your information, “Harry Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful a sleeping potion is known as the Draught of Living Death.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in Harry’s very first week — why did Professor Snape hate Professor Snape so much?
----------------------------------------------
When Harry knocked A crossbow and a pair of galoshes heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks.
----------------------------------------------
Then Hagrid voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry pulled the door open.
----------------------------------------------
“Hang on,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“Back, Fang.” Harry let Back, Fang.” in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.
----------------------------------------------
“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
----------------------------------------------
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all about Harry and Ron first lessons.
----------------------------------------------
Fang rested Fang head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over Fang robes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid , like RonRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Professor Snapeliked hardly any of the students.
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
“I liked Ron a lot — great with animals.” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
----------------------------------------------
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry remembered Ron telling Harry on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts , but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid !” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
----------------------------------------------
It might’ve been happening while we were there!” There was no doubt about It, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time.
----------------------------------------------
Harry grunted and offered Harry another rock cake.
----------------------------------------------
Harry read the story again.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry and Ron walked back to the main castle for dinner, Harry and Ron pockets weighed down with rock cakes Harry and Ron ’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given Harry as much to think about as tea with Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
And did Hagrid know something about Snape that Snape didn’t want to tell Harry?
----------------------------------------------
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL Harry had never believed Harry would meet a boy Harry hated more than Dudley, but that was before Harry met Draco Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“Typical,” said Harry darkly.
----------------------------------------------
To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.” Harry had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
----------------------------------------------
“Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good Malfoy is at Quidditch, but I bet thatSeamus’s all talk.” Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that Harry hadn’t tried.
----------------------------------------------
At breakfast on Thursday Harry bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie’s eagle owl was always bringing Malfoy ’s eagle owl packages of sweets from home, which Harry opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron jumped to Harry and Ron feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
----------------------------------------------
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for Ron, and the other Gryffindors first flying lesson.
----------------------------------------------
Come on, hurry up.” " Harry glanced down at Harry broom.
----------------------------------------------
his broom jumped into Harry hand at once, but his broom was one of the few that did.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been doing Malfoy wrong for years.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
Harry broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
“Broken wrist,” Harry heard Madam Hooch mutter.
----------------------------------------------
“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly.
----------------------------------------------
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?” “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto Harry broomstick and taken off.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hadn’t been lying, Harry could fly well.
----------------------------------------------
Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak Harry called, “Come and get Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, Potter!” Harry grabbed his broom.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” Harry ignored Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
Blood was pounding in Harry ears.
----------------------------------------------
Harry mounted his broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up Harry soared; air rushed through Harry hair, and Harry robes whipped out behind Harry — and in a rush of fierce joy Harry realized Harry’d found something Harry could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled Harry up a little to take his broomstick even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned Harry sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
----------------------------------------------
“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off his broom!” “Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
----------------------------------------------
Harry knew, somehow, what to do.
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned forward and grasped his broom tightly in both hands, and his broom shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
----------------------------------------------
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
----------------------------------------------
“Catch it if you can, then!” Harry shouted, and Harry threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the glass ball high into the air rise up in the air and then start to fall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second Harry was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in Harry ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — Harry stretched out Harry hand — a foot from the ground Harry caught a foot, just in time to pull his broom straight, and Harry toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in Harry fist.
----------------------------------------------
“HARRY POTTER!” Harry heart sank faster than Harry’d just dived.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind Hermione Granger’s.
----------------------------------------------
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane Professor McGonagall was going to use on Harry?
----------------------------------------------
“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, this is Wood .
----------------------------------------------
Was that your first time on a broomstick, Harry Potter?” Harry nodded silently.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on, but Harry didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to Harry legs.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood .
----------------------------------------------
“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Harry Potter?” Charlie Weasley asked excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie Weasley’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Light — speedy — we’ll have to get Harry a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule.
----------------------------------------------
...” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over Professor McGonagall glasses at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to hear you’re training hard, Harry Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.” Then Professor McGonagall suddenly smiled.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had just finished telling Ronwhat had happened when Harry’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about — ” “ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, Ron just sat and gaped at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I start training next week,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep Wood a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
----------------------------------------------
You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when Wood told Fred and George Weasley.” “Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood reckons Wood The boy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in we first week.
----------------------------------------------
“Having a last meal, Harry Potter?
----------------------------------------------
When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?” “You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly.
----------------------------------------------
Well meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
----------------------------------------------
“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Catching the look on Harry’s face, Harry added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.
----------------------------------------------
I bet Harry expected you to refuse, anyway.” “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” “Throw it away and punch ” on the nose,” Ronsuggested.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ignored Ron and spoke to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
It’s really very selfish of you.” “And It’s really none of your business,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as Harry lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing).
----------------------------------------------
Ron had spent all evening giving Ron advice such as “If Ron tries to curse you, you’d better dodge he tries to curse you, because I can’t remember how to block he tries to curse you.” There was a very good chance he tries to curse you were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt Harry was pushing Harry luck, breaking another school rule today.
----------------------------------------------
They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest They, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” A lamp flickered on.
----------------------------------------------
“Go back to bed!” “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — your brother’s a prefect, your brother’d put a stop to this.” Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on,” Harry said to Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the portrait hole .
----------------------------------------------
“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply.
----------------------------------------------
The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but Pig won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “How’s your arm?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry took out Harry wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.
----------------------------------------------
“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had only just raised his wand when them heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow Harry as quickly as possible; “Sniff around, my sweet scurried silently toward the door, away from the Fat Lady’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville’s robes’re in here somewhere,” Neville’s robes heard Harry mutter, “probably hiding.” “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, the others began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.
----------------------------------------------
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along a hidden passageway and came out near they Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping him forehead.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was never going to meet you Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped someone off.” Harry thought Harry was probably right, but Harry wasn’t going to tell Harry that.
----------------------------------------------
Harry caught sight of They and gave a squeal of delight.
----------------------------------------------
She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora\” the lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through the lock, shut the lock quickly, and pressed they ears against the lock, listening.
----------------------------------------------
“ thinks the door is locked,” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“I think well be okay — get off Neville !” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute.
----------------------------------------------
“What?” Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what.
----------------------------------------------
For a moment, Harry was sure Harry’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
----------------------------------------------
They weren’t in a room, as Harry had supposed.
----------------------------------------------
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at They, and Harry knew that the only reason They weren’t already dead was that They sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
----------------------------------------------
Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, Harry’d take Filch.
----------------------------------------------
They fell backward Harry Harry slammed the door shut, and They ran, They almost flew, back down a corridor.
----------------------------------------------
“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward.
----------------------------------------------
“Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” “The floor?” Harry suggested.
----------------------------------------------
“You’d think We dragged Hermione along, wouldn’t you?” But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as Ron climbed back into bed.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and Harry and Ron were quite keen to have another one.
----------------------------------------------
In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
----------------------------------------------
“Or both,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but Hermione was such a bossy know-it-all that Harry and Ron saw this as an added bonus.
----------------------------------------------
All Harry and Ron really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to Harry and Ron great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
----------------------------------------------
Harrywas just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped this large parcel right in front of Harry, knocking Harry bacon to the third floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN this large parcel AT THE TABLE.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Harry had difficulty hiding Harry glee as Harry handed the note to Ron to read.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt the package from Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s a broomstick,” That’s a broomstick said, throwing the package from Harry back to Harry Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t allowed Harry Potter.” Ron couldn’t resist it.
----------------------------------------------
What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Flitwick told me all about the special circumstances, Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
And what model is it?” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering Harry and Ron laughter at HALLOWEEN Malfoy obvious rage and confusion.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If Harry hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package from Harry in Harry’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping Harry mind on Harry lessons that day.
----------------------------------------------
It kept wandering up to the dormitory where Harry new broomstick was lying under Harry bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where Harry’d be learning to play that night.
----------------------------------------------
Harry bolted Harry dinner that evening without noticing what Harry was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
----------------------------------------------
“Wow,” Ron sighed, as his new broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.
----------------------------------------------
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful.
----------------------------------------------
As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field.
----------------------------------------------
What a feeling — Harry swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the Quidditch field.
----------------------------------------------
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever Harry wanted at Harry lightest touch.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
Harry landed next to Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
Three of them are called Chasers.” “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Oliver Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.
----------------------------------------------
Follow me?” “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put the Quaffle through the hoops to score,” Harry recited.
----------------------------------------------
“Never mind,” said Harry quickly.
----------------------------------------------
I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.” “Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to remember it all.
----------------------------------------------
“Take this.” He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
----------------------------------------------
“These two are the Bludgers.” He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the Quaffle.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding they inside the box.
----------------------------------------------
“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.
----------------------------------------------
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry swung at Harry’s face with the bat to stop Harry’s face from breaking Harry nose, and sent Harry’s face zigzagging away into the air — Harry’s face zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of Harry’s face and managed to pin Harry’s face to the ground.
----------------------------------------------
So — think you’ve got all that?” “Three The Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep The Bludgers away from the Beaters ,” Harry reeled off.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harryasked, hoping Harry sounded offhand.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, that’s it — any questions?” Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
Harry understood what Harry had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.
----------------------------------------------
Let’s try you out with a few of these.” Harry pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of Harry pocket and a few minutes later, Harry and Harry were up in the air, Oliver Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as Harry could in every direction for Harry to catch.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Oliver Wood was delighted.
----------------------------------------------
After half an hour, night had really fallen and he and Harry couldn’t carry on.
----------------------------------------------
“I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and Charlie Weasley could have played for England if Charlie Weasley hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” Perhaps it was because Charlie Weasley was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all Charlie Weasley homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when Charlie Weasley realized that Charlie Weasley’d already been at Hogwarts two months.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch Neville eye).
----------------------------------------------
Hermione hadn’t spoken to either of Ron or Hermione was angrier about this since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather Harry and Seamus were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.
----------------------------------------------
Seamus got so impatient that himself prodded the desktop with himself wand and set fire to the desktop — Harry had to put the desktop out with Harry hat.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Neville said to Harry Harry as Harry pushed Harry way into the crowded corridor, “Harry’s a nightmare, honestly.” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry caught a glimpse of Harry face — and was startled to see that Harry was in tears.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Harry heard you.” “So?” said Neville , but Neville looked a bit uncomfortable.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry must’ve noticed Harry’s got no friends.” Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon.
----------------------------------------------
On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Neville overheard Parvati Patil telling Harry friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone stared as Harry reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” Harry then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
----------------------------------------------
Excuse me, I’m a prefect!” “How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as a troll climbed the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
As They jostled They way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy!” hissed Neville , pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s Percy doing?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Neville held up Percy hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you smell something?” Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached Harry nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
----------------------------------------------
“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered.
----------------------------------------------
With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock the key.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled the door open and Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron ran inside.
----------------------------------------------
“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Neville , and, seizing a tap, Harry threw it as hard as Harry could against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
the troll mean little eyes saw Harry.
----------------------------------------------
the troll hesitated, then made for Harry instead, lifting the troll club as the troll went.
----------------------------------------------
the trolldidn’t even seem to notice a metal pipe hitting a metal pipe shoulder, but a metal pipe heard the yell and paused again, turning a metal pipe ugly snout toward Neville instead, giving Harry time to run around a metal pipe.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull Hermione toward the door, but Hermione couldn’t move, Hermione was still flat against the wall, Hermione mouth open with terror.
----------------------------------------------
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: Harry took a great running jump and managed to fasten Harry arms around the troll’s neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
the troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up even a troll nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in Harry hand when Harry’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.
----------------------------------------------
Howling with pain, even a troll twisted and flailed it club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, even a troll was going to rip Harry off or catch Harry a terrible blow with its club.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got to Harry feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was shaking and out of breath.
----------------------------------------------
“Is it — dead?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.” Neville bent down and pulled his own wand out of the troll’s nose.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was looking at Neville and Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall look so angry.
----------------------------------------------
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his own wand in the air.
----------------------------------------------
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at the third floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wished Neville would put his own wand down.
----------------------------------------------
Harrystuck his own wand up Harry nose and Neville knocked his own wand out with his own wand own club.
----------------------------------------------
It was about to finish me off when They arrived.” Harry and Neville tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was speechless.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Mind you, We did save Neville .” “Neville might not have needed saving if We hadn’t locked the thing in with Neville ,” Harry reminded Harry.
----------------------------------------------
On Saturday, Harrywould be playing in Harry first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as anyone secret weapon, Harryshould be kept, well, secret.
----------------------------------------------
But the news that Harry was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harrydidn’t know which was worse — people telling Harry Harry’d be brilliant or people telling Harry — people’d be running around underneath Harry holding a mattress.
----------------------------------------------
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all Harry homework without Harry now had Hermione as a friend, what with all the last- minute Quidditch practice Wood was making Quidditch practice Wood do.
----------------------------------------------
Harry now had Hermione as a friend had also lent Harry Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.
----------------------------------------------
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul had happened during a World Cup match in ; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Neville had saved Hermione from the mountain troll, and Hermione was much nicer for it.
----------------------------------------------
The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and Hermione had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Neville , and Hermione moved closer together to block a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from view; Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
Snape hadn’t seen a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but Snape seemed to be looking for a reason to tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione off anyway.
----------------------------------------------
Harry showed Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Five points from Gryffindor.” “He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione would never let Harry, Ron, and Hermione copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking Hermione to read it through, Harry, Ron, and Hermione got the right answers anyway.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt restless.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take Harry mind off Harry nerves about tomorrow.
----------------------------------------------
Why should Harry be afraid of Snape?
----------------------------------------------
Getting up, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask Snape if Harry could have it.
----------------------------------------------
“Better you than Harry,” Ron, and Hermione said together, but Harryhad an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.
----------------------------------------------
Harry made Harry way down to the staffroom and knocked.
----------------------------------------------
Harry knocked again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed the door ajar and peered inside — and a horrible scene met Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER!Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as Snape dropped his robes above his knees quickly to hide Snape leg.
----------------------------------------------
Harry gulped.
----------------------------------------------
OUT!” Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sprinted back upstairs.
----------------------------------------------
“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s the matter?” In a low whisper, Harry told them what Harry’d seen.
----------------------------------------------
“You know what this means?” Harry finished breathlessly.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween!
----------------------------------------------
That’s where Harry was going when we saw Harry — Harry’s after whatever it’s guarding!
----------------------------------------------
And I’d bet my broomstick Harry let that troll in, to make a diversion!” Hermione’s eyes were wide.
----------------------------------------------
“No — Harry wouldn’t,” she said.
----------------------------------------------
“I know Harry’s not very nice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m with Harry.
----------------------------------------------
What’s that dog guarding?” Harry went to bed with Harry head buzzing with the same question.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry needed to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy to forget.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m not hungry.” Harry felt terrible.
----------------------------------------------
In an hour’s time Harry’d be walking onto the field.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan.
----------------------------------------------
“Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.” “Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on Seamus sausages.
----------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into the team scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .
----------------------------------------------
“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “We were on the team last year.” “Shut up, you two,” said Wood.
----------------------------------------------
Good luck, all of you.” Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping Harry knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed that Madam Hooch seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year.
----------------------------------------------
Harrythought Flint looked as if Harry had some troll blood in Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Out of the corner of Harry eye Harry saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heart skipped.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt braver.
----------------------------------------------
“Mount your brooms, please.” Harry clambered onto Harry Nimbus Two Thousand.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid , raising Hagrid binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Way up above , Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch .
----------------------------------------------
This was part of Harry and Wood’s game plan.
----------------------------------------------
“We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.” When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off Harry feelings.
----------------------------------------------
Now Harry was back to staring around for the Snitch .
----------------------------------------------
Once Harry caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting Harry way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
----------------------------------------------
“All right there, Harry?” Harry had time to yell, as Harry beat a Bludger furiously toward Flint.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw it.
----------------------------------------------
In a great rush of excitement Harry dived downward after the streak of gold.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was faster than Terence Higgs — Harry could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — Harry put on an extra spurt of speed — WHAM!
----------------------------------------------
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.
----------------------------------------------
Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.” Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
----------------------------------------------
— Marcus Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.” It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past Harry head, that it happened.
----------------------------------------------
Harry broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch.
----------------------------------------------
For a split second, Harry thought Harry was going to fall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry gripped His broom tightly with both Harry hands and knees.
----------------------------------------------
It was as though His broom was trying to buck Harry off.
----------------------------------------------
Harrytried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — Harry had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then Harry realized that His broom was completely out of Harry control.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t turn his broom was completely out of his control.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t direct his broom was completely out of his control at all.
----------------------------------------------
his broom was completely out of his control was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated Harry.
----------------------------------------------
No one seemed to have noticed that His broom was behaving strangely His broom was carrying Harry slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as His broom went.
----------------------------------------------
“Dunno what Harry thinks Harry’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared through his binoculars.
----------------------------------------------
“If I didn’ know better, I’d say Harry’d lost control of Harry broom ...
----------------------------------------------
but Harry can’t have.
----------------------------------------------
...” Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.
----------------------------------------------
his broom had started to roll over and over, with Harry only just managing to hold on.
----------------------------------------------
his broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off a wild jerk.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was now dangling from a wild jerk, holding on with only one hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Did something happen to it when — Marcus Flint blocked Harry?” Seamus whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, Hermione started looking frantically at the whole crowd.
----------------------------------------------
Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath.
----------------------------------------------
the whole crowd was on the whole crowd feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of the whole crowd brooms, but it was no good — every time the whole crowd got near Ron, his broom would jump higher still.
----------------------------------------------
Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw Harry clap Harry hand to Harry mouth as though was about to be sick — hit the field on all fours Higgs — coughed — and something gold fell into .
----------------------------------------------
“ didn’t catch it, nearly swallowed it,” — Marcus Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heard none of this, though.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry decided on the truth.
----------------------------------------------
“I found out something about Harry,” Harry told Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween.
----------------------------------------------
It bit Harry.
----------------------------------------------
We think Harry was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.” Hagrid dropped the teapot.
----------------------------------------------
“How do you know about Fluffy?” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“ Fluffy ?” “Yeah — bought off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent to Dumbledore to guard the — ” “Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, Snape’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did Snape just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
You forget that dog, an’ you forget what His broom’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” “Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?” Hagrid looked furious with Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.” He was looking over at Harry as He spoke.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish.
----------------------------------------------
Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, He had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next.
----------------------------------------------
Then He’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on Harry bucking broomstick.
----------------------------------------------
So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.
----------------------------------------------
It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t feel sorry for Harry at all; this would probably be the best Christmas Harry’d ever had.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
----------------------------------------------
Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” “Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told Harry brightly.
----------------------------------------------
“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who Harry is.” “You what?” Hagrid looked shocked.
----------------------------------------------
“Unless you’d like to tell we and save we the trouble?” Harry added.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been wondering for a while if Nicolas Flamelwasn’t somewhere in there.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and Harry knew Harry’d never get one.
----------------------------------------------
“What are you looking for, boy?” “Nothing,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Go on — out!” Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed He, Ron, and Hermione ’d better not ask Madam Pince where He, Ron, and Hermione could find Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but Harry wasn’t very hopeful.
----------------------------------------------
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess.
----------------------------------------------
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent Harry, and old chessmen didn’t trust Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wasn’t a very good player yet and old chessmen kept shouting different bits of advice at Harry, which was confusing.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t send me there, can’t you see Harry knight?
----------------------------------------------
Send Harry, we can afford to lose Harry.” On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry woke early in the morning, however, the first thing Harry saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of Harry bed.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on Harry bathrobe.
----------------------------------------------
“You, too,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got some presents!” “What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to Ron own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.
----------------------------------------------
Harry picked up the top parcel.
----------------------------------------------
the top parcel was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across the top parcel was To Harry, from Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl.
----------------------------------------------
“ThatRon’s friendly,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
This is money?” “You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
----------------------------------------------
I told My mom you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” Ron groaned, “My mom’s made you a Weasley sweater.” Harry had torn open a very lumpy parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
----------------------------------------------
“Every year My mom makes you a Weasley sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping Ron own, “and mine’s always maroon.” “That’s really nice of My mom,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.
----------------------------------------------
Harry next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry picked This up and felt This.
----------------------------------------------
Harry unwrapped This.
----------------------------------------------
“If that’s what I think it is — they’re really rare, and really valuable.” “What is it?” Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m sure it is — try it on.” Harry threw an Invisibility Cloak around Harry shoulders and Rongave a yell.
----------------------------------------------
Look down!” Harry looked down at Harry feet, but they were gone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry dashed to the mirror.
----------------------------------------------
Sure enough, Harry reflection looked back at Harry, just Harry head suspended in midair, Harry body completely invisible.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled an Invisibility Cloak his head and Harry reflection vanished completely.
----------------------------------------------
“A note fell out of it!” Harry pulled off an Invisibility Cloak and seized the letter.
----------------------------------------------
Written in narrow, loopy writing Harry had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before Your father died.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared at a note.
----------------------------------------------
What’s the matter?” “Nothing,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt very strange.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stuffed an Invisibility Cloak quickly out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas!” “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred and Georgeholding up Harry’s sweater.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.” “Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded.
----------------------------------------------
Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing we, Harry Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses askew.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never in all Harry life had such a Christmas dinner.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and a wizard cracker didn’t just bang, a wizard cracker went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry finally left the table, Harry was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- Your-Own-Warts kit, and Harry own new wizard chess set.
----------------------------------------------
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling The white mice were going to end up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, Harry and the Weasleys returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in Harry new chess set by losing spectacularly to RonRon.
----------------------------------------------
Harry suspected Harry wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help Harry so much.
----------------------------------------------
It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever.
----------------------------------------------
Yet something had been nagging at the back of Harry mind all day.
----------------------------------------------
Not until Harry climbed into bed was Harry free to think about Not until he climbed into bed: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent Not until he climbed into bed.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother Harry , fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of Harry four-poster.
----------------------------------------------
Harryleaned over the side of Harry own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry father’s ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry let the material flow over Harry hands, smoother than silk, light as air.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had to try it, now.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped out of bed and wrapped an Invisibility Cloak around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Looking down at Harry legs, Harry saw only moonlight and shadows.
----------------------------------------------
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake.
----------------------------------------------
The whole of Hogwarts was open to Harry in an Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
Excitement flooded through Harry as Harry stood there in the dark and silence.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.
----------------------------------------------
Should Harry wake Ron?
----------------------------------------------
Harry said nothing.
----------------------------------------------
Harry lit a lamp to see Harry way along the rows of books.
----------------------------------------------
a lamp looked as if a lamp was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel Harry arm supporting a lamp, the sight gave Harry the creeps.
----------------------------------------------
Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, Harry held up a lamp to read the titles.
----------------------------------------------
They didn’t tell Harry much.
----------------------------------------------
They peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand.
----------------------------------------------
The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe Harry was imagining it, maybe not, but Harry thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had to start somewhere.
----------------------------------------------
Setting a lamp down carefully on the floor, Harry looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book.
----------------------------------------------
A large black and silver volume caught Harry eye.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled his eye out with difficulty, because his eye was very heavy, and, balancing his eye on Harry knee, let his eye fall open.
----------------------------------------------
Harry snapped One book shut, but A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stumbled backward and knocked over a lamp, which went out at once.
----------------------------------------------
Panicking, Harry heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing One book back on the bottom shelf, Harry ran for One book.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through Harry, and Harryslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, One bookFilch’s shrieks still ringing in Harry ears.
----------------------------------------------
Harry came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been so busy getting away from the library, Harry hadn’t paid attention to where Harry was going.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps because it was dark, Harry didn’t recognize where Harry was at all.
----------------------------------------------
There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, Harry knew, but Harry must be five floors above there.
----------------------------------------------
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” Harry felt the blood drain out of Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Wherever Harry was, Filch must know a shortcut, because Harry soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to Harry horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section in the library?
----------------------------------------------
Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch they.” Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.
----------------------------------------------
Filch and Snape couldn’t see Harry, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if came much nearer they’d knock right into Harry — an Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Harry from being solid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry backed away as quietly as Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
A door stood ajar to Harry left.
----------------------------------------------
A door was Harry only hope.
----------------------------------------------
Harry squeezed through A door, holding Harry breath, trying not to move A door, and to Harry relief Harry managed to get inside the room without his relief noticing anything.
----------------------------------------------
his relief walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to his relief footsteps dying away.
----------------------------------------------
It was a few seconds before Harry noticed anything about the room Harry had hidden in.
----------------------------------------------
The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but propped against the wall facing Harry was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.
----------------------------------------------
panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, wanting to look at Harry but see no reflection again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stepped in front of it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had to clap his hands to Harry mouth to stop Harry from screaming.
----------------------------------------------
Harry whirled around.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heart was pounding far more furiously than when One book had screamed — for Harry had seen not only Harry in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Breathing very fast, Harry turned slowly back to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
There Harry was, reflected in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, white and scared- looking, and there, reflected behind Harry, were at least ten others.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked over Harry shoulder — but still, no one was there.
----------------------------------------------
Was Harry in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected invisible people, invisible or not?
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling again.
----------------------------------------------
A woman standing right behind Harry reflection was smiling at Harry and waving.
----------------------------------------------
Harry reached out a hand and felt the air behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
If A woman standing right behind his reflection was really there, Harry’d touch A woman standing right behind his reflection, their reflections were so close together, but Harry felt only air — A woman standing right behind his reflection and the others existed only in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then Harry noticed that A woman standing right behind his reflection was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time.
----------------------------------------------
It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was so close to the mirror now that Harry nose was nearly touching that of Harry reflection.
----------------------------------------------
“Mom?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Dad?” They just looked at Harry, smiling.
----------------------------------------------
And slowly, Harrylooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like Harry, other noses like Harry, even a little old man who looked as though Harry had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry Harry was looking at Harry family, for the first time in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and Harry stared hungrily back at The Potters, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though Harry was hoping to fall right through the glass and reach The Potters.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had a powerful kind of ache inside Harry, half joy, half terrible sadness.
----------------------------------------------
How long Harry stood there, Harry didn’t know.
----------------------------------------------
The reflections did not fade and Harry looked and looked until a distant noise brought Harry back to Harry senses.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t stay here, Harry had to find Harry way back to bed.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tore Harry eyes away from Harry motherFilch’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.
----------------------------------------------
Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating anything?” Harry couldn’t eat.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had seen Harry parents and would be seeing his parents and again tonight.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had almost forgotten about Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
“You look odd.” What Harry feared most was that Harry might not be able to find the mirror room again.
----------------------------------------------
they tried retracing Harry’s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
----------------------------------------------
“LetFilch’s forget it and go back.” “IVo!” Harry hissed.
----------------------------------------------
Just as Ronstarted moaning that Ron feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry dropped the cloak from around Harry shoulders and ran to the mirror.
----------------------------------------------
Harry mother and father beamed at the sight of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“See?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
...” “I can only see you.” “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, Harry couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ronin Harry paisley pajamas.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Harry stood quite still, Ron and Harry thinking the same thing — did the an Invisibility Cloak work on cats?
----------------------------------------------
Come on.” And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
----------------------------------------------
“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
you go ...” “I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
That third night Harry found Harry way more quickly than before.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was walking so fast Harry knew Harry was making more noise than was wise, but Harry didn’t meet anyone.
----------------------------------------------
And there were Harry mother and father smiling at Harry again, and one of Harry grandfathers nodding happily.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.
----------------------------------------------
There was nothing to stop Harry from staying here all night with Harry family.
----------------------------------------------
Except — “So — back again, Harry?” Harry felt as though Harry insides had turned to ice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harrymust have walked straight past Harry, so desperate to get to the mirror Harry hadn’t noticed Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Albus Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that Harry was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
Does that help?” Harry thought.
----------------------------------------------
“the Mirror of Erised will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again.
----------------------------------------------
Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” Harry stood up.
----------------------------------------------
I see Dumbledore gently holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
People will insist on giving me books.” It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore gently might not have been quite truthful.
----------------------------------------------
NICHOLAS FLAMBL Dumbledore gently had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays an Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of Dumbledore gently trunk.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wished Harry could forget what Harry’d seen in the Mirror of Erised as easily, but Harry couldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Harry started having nightmares.
----------------------------------------------
Over and over again Harry dreamed about Harry parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that Filch had hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
----------------------------------------------
had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure Harry’d read the name somewhere.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.
----------------------------------------------
Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t dampen Harry spirits.
----------------------------------------------
The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side.
----------------------------------------------
Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that Harry had fewer nightmares when Harry was tired out after training.
----------------------------------------------
He’d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. “Will you stop messing around!” Harry yelled.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve just got to make sure We play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on We.” Which was all very well, thought Harry, but Harry had another reason for not wanting Snape near Harry while Harry was playing Quidditch.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess.
----------------------------------------------
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harryand Ron thought was very good for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harrysat down next to Ron, “I need to concern” Harry caught sight of Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
You look terrible.” Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
----------------------------------------------
“I can’t,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“What happened?” Hermione asked Neville’s , leading Neville’s over to sit with Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt in the pocket of Harry robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given Harry for Another Christmas.
----------------------------------------------
Harry gave it to Neville, who looked as though Harry might cry.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks, Harry ...
----------------------------------------------
D’you want the card, you collect the card, don’t you?” As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the card.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. “I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“The what?” said Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
----------------------------------------------
I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep it safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew someone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is Ron?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d do with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t until Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
----------------------------------------------
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever Harry told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know whether Harry was imagining it or not, but Harry seemed to keep running into Snape wherever Harry went.
----------------------------------------------
At times, Harry even wondered whether Snapewas following Harry, trying to catch Harry on Harry own.
----------------------------------------------
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t see how Harry could — yet Harry sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
----------------------------------------------
Harry knew, when they wished Harry good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ronand Hermione were wondering whether Ron and Hermione’d ever see Harry alive again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as Harry pulled on his robes and picked up Harry Nimbus Two Thousand.
----------------------------------------------
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
----------------------------------------------
They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if Snape showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Even — blimey — Snape’s come to watch!” Harry’s heart did a somersault.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was safe.
----------------------------------------------
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt Harry if Dumbledore gently was watching.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” “What?
----------------------------------------------
Where?” Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione stood up, Hermione crossed fingers in Hermione mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Up in the air, Snape turned on Snape broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past Snape, missing Snape by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, Harry arm raised in triumph, the Snitchclasped in the Snitch hand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s won!
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped off Harry broom, a foot from the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t believe it.
----------------------------------------------
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
----------------------------------------------
“Well done,” said Dumbledore gently quietly, so that Harry Harry could hear.
----------------------------------------------
Jc Jc Jc Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take Harry Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t ever remember feeling happier.
----------------------------------------------
He’d really done something to be proud of now — no one could say Harry was just a famous name any more.
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had reached the shed.
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with the wooden door windows glowing red in the setting sun.
----------------------------------------------
He’d done Gryffindor in the lead, Harry’d shown Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s victory faded from Harry’s mind as Harry’s watched.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s recognized A hooded figure prowling walk.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped back on Harry Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.
----------------------------------------------
Gliding silently over the castle Harry saw Snape enter the forbidden forest at a run.
----------------------------------------------
Harry followed.
----------------------------------------------
The trees were so thick Harry couldn’t see where Snapehad gone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until Harry heard voices.
----------------------------------------------
Harry glided toward he heard voices and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.
----------------------------------------------
Harry climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.
----------------------------------------------
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but Harry wasn’t alone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t make out the look on Harry face, but Harry was stuttering worse than ever.
----------------------------------------------
Harry strained to catch what they were saying.
----------------------------------------------
“Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” Harry leaned forward.
----------------------------------------------
“I-I don’t know what you — ” “You know perfectly well what I mean.” An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree.
----------------------------------------------
It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though Harry was petrified.
----------------------------------------------
Jc Jc Jc “Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.
----------------------------------------------
We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.” “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days Harry gave Harry an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but Hermione kept nagging Harry and Ron to do the same.
----------------------------------------------
Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ronspent most of their free time in the library with Harry, trying to get through all their extra work.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until Ron heard Ron say, “Hagrid!
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ go shoutin’ about shoutin, what’s the matter with yeh?” “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” “SHHHH!” said Hagrid again.
----------------------------------------------
They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ” “See you later, then,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.” it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” always wanted a dragon, it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” told me so the first time I ever met a dragon,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
You should see the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.” “But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” “Yes,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others.
----------------------------------------------
I’m boiling.” “Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed Harry glance at the fire.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at the fire, too.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid — what’s that?” But Harry already knew what it was.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, “That’s — er ...” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too.
----------------------------------------------
It was driving Harry and Ron nuts.
----------------------------------------------
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had written only two words: It’s a Norwegian Ridge-back hatching.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, how many times in our lives are our going to see a dragon hatching?” “our’ve got lessons, our’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone finds out what someone ’s doing — ” “Shut up!” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.
----------------------------------------------
The baby dragon wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s the matter?” “Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains — it’s a kid — it’s a kid runnin’ back up ter the school.” Harry bolted to the door and looked out.
----------------------------------------------
Even at a distance there was no mistaking Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous.
----------------------------------------------
“Just let Hagrid ’s go,” Harry urged.
----------------------------------------------
Where’s Mommy?” “The baby dragon’s lost The baby dragon marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and ’s going to be as long as your house.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I know I can’t keep Hagrid forever, but I can’t jus’ dump Hagrid, can’t.” Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
----------------------------------------------
Ron appeared out of nowhere as Ron pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let It’s Hedwig in.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case his gets lonely.” From inside a large crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though his teddy was having his teddy head torn off.
----------------------------------------------
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Mommy will never forget you!” How Harry and Hermione managed to get a large crate back up to the castle, Harry and Hermione never knew.
----------------------------------------------
Midnight ticked nearer as Harry and Hermione heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.
----------------------------------------------
Up another staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier.
----------------------------------------------
“Nearly there!” Harry panted as Harry and Hermione reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.
----------------------------------------------
Then a sudden movement ahead of Harry and Hermione made Harry and Hermione almost drop a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
Forgetting that Harry and Hermione were already invisible, Harry and Hermione shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter’s coming — Professor’s got a dragon!” “What utter rubbish!
----------------------------------------------
I could sing!” “Don’t,” Harry advised her.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie’s friends showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so Charlie’s friends could suspend Norbert between Charlie’s friends.
----------------------------------------------
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked Harry and Hermione very much.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione slipped back down the spiral staircase, Harry and Hermione hearts as light as Harry and Hermione hands, now that Norbert was off Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — what could spoil Harry and Hermione happiness?
----------------------------------------------
Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more feeble than the last.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t see how Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories were going to get out of trouble this time.
----------------------------------------------
Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse?
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wrong.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment Neville saw the other two.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
a drag — ” Harry looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as a drag — ” Harry towered over the three of them.
----------------------------------------------
a drag — ” Harry was staring at a drag — ” Harry slippers, as still as a statue.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed the story, too?” Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell Harry without words that this wasn’t true, because Nevillewas looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
Poor, blundering Neville Harry knew what it must have cost Harry to try and find Neville was looking stunned and hurt in the dark, to warn Neville was looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
As for you, Harry Potter’s , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this.
----------------------------------------------
All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.” “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor — please — ” “You can’t—” “Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Harry Potter’s .
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of Harry stomach.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t sleep all night.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could hear Nevillesobbing into Harry pillow for what seemed like hours.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry knew Neville, like Harry, was dreading the dawn.
----------------------------------------------
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost their all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
----------------------------------------------
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated.
----------------------------------------------
Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on Harry, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup.
----------------------------------------------
Everywhere Harrywent, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower people voices as people insulted Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Harry Potter’s , we owe you one!” Only Ron stood by Only Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time Fred and George ’ve been here, and people still like Fred and George .” “Fred and George ’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have Fred and George ?” said Harry miserably.
----------------------------------------------
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harryswore to Harry not to meddle in things that weren’t Harry business from now on.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt so ashamed of Harry that Harry went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the Quidditch team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if The rest of the team had to speak about Harry, The rest of the team called Harry “the Seeker.” Hermione and Neville were suffering, too.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione and Neville didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because Hermione and Neville weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to Hermione and Neville, either.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away.
----------------------------------------------
All the studying Harry had to do kept Harry mind off Harry misery.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept to He, Ron, and Hermione, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.
----------------------------------------------
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an unexpected test.
----------------------------------------------
Walking back from the library on Harry own one afternoon, Harry heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry drew closer, Harry heard Quirrell’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry moved closer.
----------------------------------------------
“All right — all right — ” Harry heard Quirrell sob.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell strode out of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Harrywas halfway toward a door before Harry remembered what Harry’d promised Harry about not meddling.
----------------------------------------------
All the same, Harry’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in Snape step Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.
----------------------------------------------
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy what Harry’d heard.
----------------------------------------------
So what do we do, Harry?” The light of adventure was kindling again in Harry’seyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
If we try anything we we’ll be thrown out for sure.” “But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“If we just do a bit of poking around — ” “No,” said Harry flatly, ““’ve done enough poking around.” Harry pulled a map of Jupiter toward Harry and started to learn the names of moons.
----------------------------------------------
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they’d lost.
----------------------------------------------
Like Harry, Hermione felt they deserved what they’d got.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.
----------------------------------------------
“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you, eh?” Harry said, leering at Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wondered what the chains punishment was going to be.
----------------------------------------------
Hurry up, I want ter get started.” Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad.
----------------------------------------------
“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.” Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.
----------------------------------------------
All right, Harry, Hermione?” “I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” , Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” ’re here to be punished, after all.” “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m not going in that forest,” ’m said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in Harry voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry are if Harry want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely.
----------------------------------------------
If Harry think yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an’ pack.
----------------------------------------------
“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other.
----------------------------------------------
Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s that’s — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all come an’ find Harry — so, be careful — let’s go.” The forest was black and silent.
----------------------------------------------
A little way into The forest they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted Harry and Hermione off the path behind a towering oak.
----------------------------------------------
The three of Harry and Hermione listened.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.” “A werewolf?” Harry suggested.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.
----------------------------------------------
“How are Harry?” Harry walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the way.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s a centaur.” “We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.
----------------------------------------------
We’ll be off, then.” Harry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, staring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked Harry and Hermione view.
----------------------------------------------
Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” “Are there many of Harry and Hermione in here?” asked Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Keep Harry and Hermione to Harry and Hermione mostly, but Harry and Hermione’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione’re deep, mind, centaurs ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione know things ...
----------------------------------------------
jus’ don’ let on much.” “D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harrykept looking nervously over Harry shoulder.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had the nasty feeling the unicorns were being watched.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was very glad the unicorns had Hagrid and Harry crossbow with the unicorns.
----------------------------------------------
“Stay on the path, I’ll come back for Harry!” the unicorns heard Harry crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until the unicorns couldn’t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around the unicorns.
----------------------------------------------
it’s ’m fault Harry’s here in the first place.” The minutes dragged by.
----------------------------------------------
Right, ’m’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with Neville an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot.
----------------------------------------------
I’m sorry,Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but Harry’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.
----------------------------------------------
Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.
----------------------------------------------
“Look — ” Harry murmured, holding out Harry arm to stop Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where Harry had fallen and Harry mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had taken one step toward Harry when a slithering sound made Harry freeze where Harry stood.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed.
----------------------------------------------
a hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down a hooded figure front.
----------------------------------------------
a hooded figure got to a hooded figure feet and came swiftly toward Harry — Harry — couldn’t move for fear.
----------------------------------------------
Then a pain like Harry —’d never felt before pierced Harry — head; it was as though Harry — scar were on fire.
----------------------------------------------
Half blinded, Harry — staggered backward.
----------------------------------------------
Harry — heard hooves behind Harry —, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at a hooded figure.
----------------------------------------------
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad Harry fell to Harry knees.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry looked up, a hooded figure had gone.
----------------------------------------------
A centaur was standing over Harry, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; Harry had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to its feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked carefully at Harry, astonishingly blue eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
“You are the Potter boy,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“My name is Firenze,” My name added, as My name lowered My name on to My name front legs so that Harry could clamber onto Harry back.
----------------------------------------------
It is not we business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in we forest!Firenze suddenly reared on to Firenze hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab Harry shoulders to stay on.
----------------------------------------------
I set myself against what is lurking in The forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside myself if I must.” And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best Harry could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind Ronan and Bane.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.
----------------------------------------------
“Why’s Bane so angry?” Harry asked.
----------------------------------------------
“What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep Harry head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question.
----------------------------------------------
They made They way through the trees in silence for so long that Harrythought Firenze didn’t want to talk to Harry anymore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry PotterHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?” “No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question.
----------------------------------------------
You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment The blood of a unicorn touches your lips.” Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.
----------------------------------------------
“But who’d be that desperate?” Harry wondered aloud.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?” “The Sorcerer’s Stone!
----------------------------------------------
Over the rustling of the trees, Harry seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told Harry on the night they had met: “Some say Harry died.
----------------------------------------------
Dunno if Harry had enough human left in Harry to die.” “Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was VoZ — ” HarryHarry!
----------------------------------------------
Harry, are you all right?” Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what Harry was saying.
----------------------------------------------
“You are safe now.” Harry slid off Harry back.
----------------------------------------------
“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze.
----------------------------------------------
I hope this is one of those times.” Harry turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook Harry awake.
----------------------------------------------
In a matter of seconds, though, Harry was wide- eyed as Harry began to tell Harry and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t sit down.
----------------------------------------------
Harry paced up and down in front of the fire.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was still shaking.
----------------------------------------------
...” “Stop saying the name!” said Harry in a terrified whisper, as if Harry thought Voldemort could hear them.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wasn’t listening.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose thathe’s here in the first place.” written in the stars as well.” “Will you stop saying the name\” Harry hissed.
----------------------------------------------
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry pulled back Harry sheets, Harry found Harry Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath his sheets.
----------------------------------------------
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how Harry had managed to get through Harry exams when Harry half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment.
----------------------------------------------
Harry did the best Harry could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in Harry forehead, which had been bothering Harry ever since Harry trip into the forest.
----------------------------------------------
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by Harry old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harryhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on they foreheads, but Harry and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about The Sorcerer’s Stone as HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
When the ghost of Professor Binns told they to put down they quills and roll up they parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest.
----------------------------------------------
“I needn’t have learned about the Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Harry said this made Harry feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
----------------------------------------------
“No more studying,” Harry sighed happily, stretching out on the grass.
----------------------------------------------
“You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” Harry was rubbing Harry forehead.
----------------------------------------------
“I wish I knew what this means\” Harry burst out angrily.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m not ill,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky mouth.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was the only one who ever sent Harry letters.
----------------------------------------------
but — Harry suddenly jumped to Harry feet.
----------------------------------------------
“Where ’re you going?” said Harry sleepily.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had turned white.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagridwants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in a dragon pocket?
----------------------------------------------
Why didn’t I see it before?” “What are you talking about?” said Harry, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.
----------------------------------------------
Got time fer a drink?” “Yes, please,” said Harry, but Harry cut Harry off.
----------------------------------------------
I never saw Mighta bin a dragon dealer face, Mighta bin a dragon dealer kept Mighta bin a dragon dealer hood up.” Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.
----------------------------------------------
“What did you talk to Harry about, Hagrid?
----------------------------------------------
...” “And did it ter — did it ter seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to keep it ter voice calm.
----------------------------------------------
Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Harry, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.
----------------------------------------------
“us want to see Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Harry thought.
----------------------------------------------
“Why?” Harry swallowed — now what?
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “DumbledoreThe unicorn’s dead gone?” said Harry frantically.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once Harry was sure Professorwas out of earshot.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Harry wheeled round.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron stared at Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry and Ron were — ” Harry began, without any idea what Harry was going to say.
----------------------------------------------
And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can Gryffindor?” Harry flushed.
----------------------------------------------
Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, you’d better do that.” “Why me?” “It’s obvious,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” Harry put on a high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong.
----------------------------------------------
“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” Harry and Ron went back to the common room.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m sorry, Harry!” Professor McGonagall wailed.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get Snape, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” “Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.” “You’re mad!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
You’ll be expelled!” “SO WHAT?” Harry shouted.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s just lucky I got It back.” “But will it cover all three of us?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Nobody bothered I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all.
----------------------------------------------
This was the first night Harry hadn’t been upset by This.
----------------------------------------------
Harryand Harry didn’t talk much.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron Harry and Ron were thinking about what Harry and Ron were about to do.
----------------------------------------------
“Better get the cloak,” Harry muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning.
----------------------------------------------
Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given Harry for Christmas.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pocketed the flute Hagrid to use on Fluffy — Harry didn’t feel much like singing.
----------------------------------------------
Harry ran back down to the common room.
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting cloak behind Harry back.
----------------------------------------------
Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling Neville to do something desperate.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll — I’ll fight you!” Neville,” Harry exploded, “get away from the portrait hole and don’t be an idiot — ” “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville.
----------------------------------------------
And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes, but not to us,” said Harry in exasperation.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m ready!” Harry turned to Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“What’ve you done to ?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Harry as they stepped over Harry and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, let’s kick Mrs. Norris, just this once,” Harry whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’s there?” Harry’s ear said suddenly as they climbed toward Harry’s ear.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s ear narrowed Harry’s ear wicked black eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” Harry’s ear rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.
----------------------------------------------
“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.” Harry had a sudden idea.
----------------------------------------------
“Peeves,” Harry said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has Baron own reasons for being invisible.” Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock.
----------------------------------------------
“My mistake, My mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie Peevsie little joke, sir.” “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Harry.
----------------------------------------------
A few seconds later, “Brilliant, Harry!” were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.” Seeing the door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of “Brilliant, Harry!” what was facing “Brilliant, Harry!”.
----------------------------------------------
Underneath cloak, Harry turned to the other two.
----------------------------------------------
“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“You can take cloak, I won’t need cloak now.” “Don’t be stupid,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed the door open.
----------------------------------------------
“Looks like a harp,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape must have left it there.” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hardly drew breath.
----------------------------------------------
“Keep playing,” Harry warned Harry as they slipped out of cloak and crept toward the trapdoor.
----------------------------------------------
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Harry, peering over the dog’s back.
----------------------------------------------
“Want to go first, Hermione?” “No, I don’t!” “All right.” Harry gritted Harry teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
----------------------------------------------
Harry bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Harry to get Harry attention and pointed at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Are you sure?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Give the flute to Hermione so Hermione can keep Hermione asleep.” Harry handed the flute over.
----------------------------------------------
Harry climbed over the dog and looked down through the trapdoor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry lowered Harry through the hole until Harry was hanging on by Harry fingertips.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry looked up at Harry Harry and said, “If anything happens to Harry, don’t follow.
----------------------------------------------
Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
...” And Harry let go.
----------------------------------------------
Cold, damp air rushed past Harry as Harry fell down, down, down and — FLUMP.
----------------------------------------------
With a funny, muffled sort of thump Harry landed on something soft.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat up and felt around, Harry eyes not used to the gloom.
----------------------------------------------
his eyes felt as though Harry was sitting on some sort of plant.
----------------------------------------------
“his eyes’s okay!” Harry called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “his eyes’s a soft landing, you can jump!” Harry followed right away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry landed, sprawled next to HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s this stuff?” were Harry first words.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione landed on Harry’s other side.
----------------------------------------------
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
As for Harry and Harry, Harry and Ron legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without Harry and Ron noticing.
----------------------------------------------
“I know what this is — this’s Devil’s Snare!” “Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s great help,” snarled Harry, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around Harry neck.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around Harry chest.
----------------------------------------------
— it likes the dark and the damp — ” “So light a fire!” Harry choked.
----------------------------------------------
“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Harry bellowed.
----------------------------------------------
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as Harry joined Hermione by the wall, wiping sweat off Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah,” said Harry, “and Harry Harry doesn’t lose Harry head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
----------------------------------------------
The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts.
----------------------------------------------
With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, Harry remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you hear something?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry listened.
----------------------------------------------
sounds like wings to Harry.” “There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.” the dragons reached the end of The passageway and saw before the dragons a brilliantly lit chamber, a brilliantly lit chamber ceiling arching high above the dragons.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think the dragons’ll attack us if us cross the room?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Probably,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Now what?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“These birds ...’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” “But there are hundreds of them!” Harry examined the lock on the door.
----------------------------------------------
Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century.
----------------------------------------------
Harry the youngest Seeker had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, Harry the youngest Seeker noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if he had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
----------------------------------------------
“That one!” Harry the youngest Seeker called to the others.
----------------------------------------------
“That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.” Harry went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off Harry broom.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve got to close in on his broom!” Harry called, not taking Harry eyes off a large silver key that had a bent wing with the damaged wing.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, you come at his broom from above Hermione, stay below and stop his broom from going down — and I’ll try and catch his broom.
----------------------------------------------
Right, NOW!” Harry dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione ’s cheers echoed around a brilliantly lit chamber.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in one hand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry rammed the door into the lock and turned — the door worked.
----------------------------------------------
“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, Harry hand on the door handle.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled the door open.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Harry and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.
----------------------------------------------
“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s obvious, isn’t It?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I think,” said Harry, “We’re going to have to be chessmen.” Harry walked up to a black knight and put Harry hand out to touch the knights horse.
----------------------------------------------
the knights horse pawed the ground and a black knightturned a black knight helmeted head to look down at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned to the other two.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Harrythink.
----------------------------------------------
Finally Harry said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of Harry are that good at chess — “we’re not offended,” said Harry quickly.
----------------------------------------------
“Just tell we what to do.” “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” “What about you?” “I’m going to be a knight,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned a knight, a bishop, and a castle backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Harry, and Hermione took.
----------------------------------------------
“White always plays first in chess,” said Harry, peering across the board.
----------------------------------------------
Harry started to direct the white pieces.
----------------------------------------------
the white pieces moved silently wherever Harry sent the white pieces.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s knees were trembling.
----------------------------------------------
“Had to let that happen,” said Harry, looking shaken.
----------------------------------------------
Twice, Harry only just noticed in time that Harry, Ron and Hermione were in danger.
----------------------------------------------
Harry darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as Harry, Ron and Hermione had lost black ones.
----------------------------------------------
“We’re nearly there,” Harry muttered suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
“Let me think — let me think ...” The white queen turned The white queen blank face toward Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes ...” said Harry softly, “it’s the only way ...
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got to be taken.” “NO!” Harry, Ron and Hermione shouted.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s chess!” snapped Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I make my move and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” “But — of course“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” “Ron — ” “Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the Stone!” There was no alternative.
----------------------------------------------
“Ready?” Harry called, Harry face pale but determined.
----------------------------------------------
“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.” Harry stepped forward, and The white queen pounced.
----------------------------------------------
The white queen struck Harry hard across the head with The white queen stone arm, and Harry crashed to the floor — Hermionescreamed but stayed on The white queen square — The white queen dragged Harry to one side.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked as if Harry’d been knocked out.
----------------------------------------------
Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.
----------------------------------------------
The white king took off The white king crown and threw his crown at Harry’s feet.
----------------------------------------------
With one last desperate look back at Harry, Harry and Hermionecharged through the door and up the next passageway.
----------------------------------------------
“What if Harry’s — ?” “Harry’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“All right?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Go on.” Harry pushed it open.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, I can’t breathe.” Harry pulled open another door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked over Harry shoulder to read her shoulder: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among us number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.
----------------------------------------------
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, us give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in dwarf nor giant insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste twins, though different at first sight Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that Hermione was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
----------------------------------------------
“The smallest bottle will get The smallest bottlethrough the black fire — toward the Stone.” Harry looked at The smallest bottle.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s only enough there for one of us,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“You drink that,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“No, listen, get back and get Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for Dumbledore, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at Harry scar.
----------------------------------------------
“I might get lucky again.” Hermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Hermionel” “Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” “I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as Hermione let go of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be carefull” “You drink first,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.
----------------------------------------------
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned to face the black flames.
----------------------------------------------
“Here I come,” Harry said, and Harry drained the smallest bottlein one gulp.
----------------------------------------------
It was indeed as though ice was flooding Harry body.
----------------------------------------------
Harry put the smallest bottle down and walked forward; Harry braced Harry, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel the black flames — for a moment Harry could see nothing but dark fire — then Harry was on the other side, in the last chamber.
----------------------------------------------
“You\” gasped Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Next to Severus, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?Harry Harry couldn’t take it in.
----------------------------------------------
Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped Ropes tightly around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrelltalking and stop Quirrell from concentrating on the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
but where is the Stone?” Harry struggled against the ropes binding Harry, but they didn’t give.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had to keep Quirrell from giving Harry whole attention to the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
“Sometimes,” Snape said, “I find it hard to follow “Master’s instructions — Snape is a great wizard and I am weak — ” “You mean Snape was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was remembering Harry trip to Diagon Alley — how could Harry have been so stupid?
----------------------------------------------
Harry’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with Harry in the Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
Should I break the mirror?” Harry’s mind was racing.
----------------------------------------------
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, Harry thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around Harry ankles were too tight: Harry tripped and fell over.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrellignored Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was still talking to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Help me, “Master!” And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Use the boy ...” Quirrell rounded on Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got slowly to Harry feet.
----------------------------------------------
“Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.” Harry walked toward Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I must lie, Harry thought desperately.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell moved close behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban.
----------------------------------------------
the reflection winked and put the Stone back in the Stone pocket — and as the reflection did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into its pocket.
----------------------------------------------
Somehow — incredibly — Harry’d gotten the Stone.
----------------------------------------------
“What do you see?” Harry screwed up Harry courage.
----------------------------------------------
“I see Harry shaking hands with Dumbledore,” Dumbledore invented.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry moved aside, Dumbledore felt the Stone against Dumbledore leg.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting Devil’s Snare to the spot.
----------------------------------------------
Harry would have screamed, but Harry couldn’t make a sound.
----------------------------------------------
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
----------------------------------------------
face Harry was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter ...” face Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to take a step backward but Harry legs wouldn’t move.
----------------------------------------------
“See what I have become?” a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen said.
----------------------------------------------
The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t be a fool,” snarled a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
----------------------------------------------
...” “LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was walking backward at Harry, so that Voldemort could still see Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Now give me the Stone, unless you want your mother to have died in vain.” “NEVER!” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist.
----------------------------------------------
At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; Harry head felt as though it was about to split in two; Harry yelled, struggling with all Harry might, and to Harry surprise, Quirrell let go of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The pain in Harry head lessened — Harry looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw Harry hunched in pain, looking at Harry fingers — they were blistering before Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Seize Harry!
----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, bewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
----------------------------------------------
“Then kill Harry, fool, and be done!” screeched Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell raised Quirrell hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — “AAAARGH!” Quirrell rolled off Quirrell, Quirrell face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch Harry bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep his in enough pain to stop his from doing a curse.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only hear Harry’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
----------------------------------------------
KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry!
----------------------------------------------
Harry!” Harry felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from Harry grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ...
----------------------------------------------
Something gold was glinting just above Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to catch it, but Harry arms were too heavy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry blinked.
----------------------------------------------
Harry blinked again.
----------------------------------------------
“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared at Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry remembered: “Sir!
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s got the Stone!
----------------------------------------------
Sir, quick — “Calm yourself, Harry Potter, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Sir, I — ” Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.” Harry swallowed and looked around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry realized Harry must be in the hospital wing.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to Harry was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.
----------------------------------------------
As for the Stone, Not the Stone, boy has been destroyed.” “Destroyed?” said Harry blankly.
----------------------------------------------
Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” “But that means Nicolas and Nicolas wife will die, won’t he and his wife?” “he and his wife have enough Elixir stored to set he and his wife affairs in order and then, yes, he and his wife will die.” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for humans.” Harry lay there, lost for words.
----------------------------------------------
Sir?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Sir — even if Harry’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” “Call Sir Voldemort, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Well, Harry’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t Harry’s ?
----------------------------------------------
I mean, Harry’s hasn’t gone, has Harry’s ?” “No, Harry, Harry’s has not.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share ...
----------------------------------------------
not being truly alive, Harry’s cannot be killed.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s left Quirrell to die; Harry’s shows just as little mercy to Harry’s followers as Harry’s enemies.
----------------------------------------------
Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed Harry return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if Harry is delayed again, and again, why, Harry may never return to power.” Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made Harry head hurt.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry said, Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ...
----------------------------------------------
put it from your mind for now, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
when you are ready, you will know.” And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.
----------------------------------------------
It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.” Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry Harry eyes on the sheet.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry had found Harry voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent his voice to me?” “Ah — your father happened to leave his voice in my possession, and I thought you might like his voice.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry tried to understand this but this made Harry head pound, so Harry stopped.
----------------------------------------------
“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.
----------------------------------------------
“Harryl” Hermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” again, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry head was still very sore.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so worried — ” “The whole school’s talking about The whole school’s,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
----------------------------------------------
“So Harry’s gone?” said Ron finally.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s just going to die?” “That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it?
----------------------------------------------
“So what happened to Ron and Hermione two?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met Dumbledore in the entrance hall — Dumbledore already knew — Dumbledore just said, ‘Harry’s gone after Harry, hasn’t Harry?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” “D’you think “D’you meant you to do “D’you?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” “Well,” Hermione exploded, “if “D’you did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” “No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully.
----------------------------------------------
•k k k After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to go to the end- of-year feast,” Harry told Madam Pomfrey as Madam Pomfrey straightened Harry many candy boxes.
----------------------------------------------
“And you have another visitor.” “Oh, good,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore sat down next to Harry, took one look at Dumbledore, and burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into Yeh beard.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ don’ say the name!” “VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, Harry stopped crying.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve met Harry and I’m calling Harry by Harry name.
----------------------------------------------
Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, itHarry’s gone, Harry can’t use it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry opened this curiously.
----------------------------------------------
Smiling and waving at Harry from every page were Harry mother and father.
----------------------------------------------
d’yeh like it?” Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.
----------------------------------------------
Harry made Harry way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving Harry one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging Harry goblet on the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Those who could add up while yelling themselves had tied for the House Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Snape caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape ’s feelings toward Snape hadn’t changed one jot.
----------------------------------------------
This didn’t worry Harry.
----------------------------------------------
It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry would never, ever forget tonight.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come the exam results were still to come did.
----------------------------------------------
To the exam results were still to come great surprise, both Harry and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled People as People moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
----------------------------------------------
Some of People called: “Bye, Harry!” “See you, Harry Potter!” “Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter!” she squealed.
----------------------------------------------
“Very,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.
----------------------------------------------
Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You must be Harry’s family!” said Fred Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over Harry face.
----------------------------------------------

Potter
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Potter wasn’t such an unusual name.
----------------------------------------------
Potter was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Come to think of it, Potter wasn’t even sure Potter nephew was called Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Potter’d never even seen the boy.
----------------------------------------------
Potter didn’t blame Mrs. Dursley — if Potter’d had a sister like that ...
----------------------------------------------
Potter found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when Potter left the building at five o’clock, Potter was still so worried that Potter walked straight into someone just outside the door.
----------------------------------------------
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that Lily and James Potter are —’re — dead.” Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
“’re the only family Harry has left now.” “You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to Professor McGonagall Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter come and live here!” “It’s the best place for him,” said Albus Dumbledore firmly.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter rolled over inside Harry Potter blankets without waking up.
----------------------------------------------
One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was special, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as Mrs. Dursley opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter Aunt Petunia was awake and His Aunt Petunia was His Aunt Petunia shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald- green ink.
----------------------------------------------
Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, Privet Drive — ’ ” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.

----------------------------------------------
“Then my dratted sister met that Potter at school and my mother and father left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, my dratted sister went and got my dratted sister blown up and we got landed with my dratted sister!” Deputy Headmistress Potter at school had gone very white.
----------------------------------------------
“How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter?
----------------------------------------------
How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter’s an outrage!
----------------------------------------------
Potter at school not knowin’ Potter at school own story when every kid in our world knows Potter at school name!” “But why?
----------------------------------------------
People who was on ’d side came back ter Potter at school and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome back, Harry Potter ..., welcome back.” Harry didn’t know what to say.
----------------------------------------------
“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “So proud, Harry Potter ..., I’m just so proud.” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in Harry excitement.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
“N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” “Professor Quirrell laughed nervously.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, now — Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
As measured, said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Right then, Mr. Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter.
----------------------------------------------
I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“ Harry Potter,” chorused the red-haired twins .
----------------------------------------------
“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Three boys’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment.
----------------------------------------------
So all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment’s you, is all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment?” “Yes,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” My father said slowly.
----------------------------------------------
Neville, the boy who kept losing Harry Potter toad, sniffed once or twice.
----------------------------------------------
flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts crowded in, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
, and then, at last — “Potter, Harry!” As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.
----------------------------------------------
“ Potter , did Anne” say?” “ “ Potter?” The last thing Harry saw before a pointed wizard’s hat dropped over Harry eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Percy the Prefect got up and shook Harry hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Harry Potter!
----------------------------------------------
We got Harry Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff Harry’d seen earlier.
----------------------------------------------
— all the way down the garden and into the road were all Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.” Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
At the top of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, yes,” Professor Snape said softly, “Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter!” said Professor Snape suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it would go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, “Harry Potter?” Harry forced Harry to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“For your information, “Harry Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful a sleeping potion is known as the Draught of Living Death.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell You — Potter — not to add the porcupine quills?
----------------------------------------------
Thought You — Potter —’d make you look good if You — Potter — got it wrong, did you?
----------------------------------------------
“Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good Malfoy is at Quidditch, but I bet thatSeamus’s all talk.” Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak Harry called, “Come and get Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, Potter!” Harry grabbed his broom.
----------------------------------------------
“HARRY POTTER!” Harry heart sank faster than Harry’d just dived.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, this is Wood .
----------------------------------------------
Was that your first time on a broomstick, Harry Potter?” Harry nodded silently.
----------------------------------------------
“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Harry Potter?” Charlie Weasley asked excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to hear you’re training hard, Harry Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.” Then Professor McGonagall suddenly smiled.
----------------------------------------------
“Having a last meal, Harry Potter?
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t allowed Harry Potter.” Ron couldn’t resist it.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Flitwick told me all about the special circumstances, Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” Potter was Quidditch Through the Ages.
----------------------------------------------
“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER!Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as Snape dropped his robes above his knees quickly to hide Snape leg.
----------------------------------------------
It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.
----------------------------------------------
Out of the corner of Harry eye Harry saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter’s coming — Professor’s got a dragon!” “What utter rubbish!
----------------------------------------------
As for you, Harry Potter’s , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor — please — ” “You can’t—” “Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Harry Potter’s .
----------------------------------------------
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost their all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
----------------------------------------------
Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Harry Potter’s , we owe you one!” Only Ron stood by Only Ron.
----------------------------------------------
This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the way.
----------------------------------------------
“You are the Potter boy,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“This is the Potter boy.
----------------------------------------------
The quicker the Potter boy leaves The forest, the better.” “What have you been telling the Potter boy?” growled Bane.
----------------------------------------------
Harry PotterHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?” “No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?” “The Sorcerer’s Stone!
----------------------------------------------
“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal no one, no one’s too well protected.” “But Professor — ” “Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” Professor McGonagall said shortly.
----------------------------------------------
“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — Snape — ” “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and Quirrell wasn’t Quirrell usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re too nosy to live, Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, wait quietly, Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes — Potter — come here.” — Potter — clapped — Potter — hands once, and the ropes around his ankles fell off.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore lies ...” Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter ...” face Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared at Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Sir, quick — “Calm yourself, Harry Potter, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Some of People called: “Bye, Harry!” “See you, Harry Potter!” “Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter!” she squealed.
----------------------------------------------

Muggle
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley also thought Mr. Dursley had been called a Muggle, whatever that was.
----------------------------------------------
People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.” She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Albus Dumbledore here, as though hoping Albus Dumbledore was going to tell She something, but Albus Dumbledore didn’t, so She went on.
----------------------------------------------
We’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.” “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though Professor McGonagall didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop a great Muggle,” a great Muggle said.
----------------------------------------------
“A Muggle,” said Hagrid Hagrid, “A Muggle’s what we call nonmagic folk like them.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve read those letters and Uncle Vernon needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and — ” “If Uncle Vernon wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop Uncle Vernon,” growled Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as Muggle called it, gave the bills to Harry so Muggle could buy Hagrid, who didn’t tickets.
----------------------------------------------
“ — and Harry said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in — ” “Yer not from a Muggle family.
----------------------------------------------
If Yer not from a Muggle family’d known who yeh were — Yer not from a Muggle familygrown up knowin’ yer name if Yer not from a Muggle family parents are wizardin’ folk.
----------------------------------------------
Anyway, what does Yer not from a Muggle family know about the Leaky Cauldron, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum!
----------------------------------------------
It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” “School Houses.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find out how to curse even Dudley.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
ThereNow Percy’s a prefect loads of people who come from Muggle families and There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families learn quick enough.” While There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families had been talking, the train had carried There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families out of London.
----------------------------------------------
Now There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep.
----------------------------------------------
There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
----------------------------------------------
“But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” “Do they?
----------------------------------------------
“Me dad’s a Muggle.
----------------------------------------------
Mom didn’t tell ’s a Muggle.
----------------------------------------------
Bit of a nasty shock for ’s a Muggle.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, Gran brought me up and Mom’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages.
----------------------------------------------
Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like Harry, hadn’t had any idea that Lots of people were witches and wizards.
----------------------------------------------
They reminded Harrythe little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that They were fifty feet high.
----------------------------------------------
This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle.
----------------------------------------------
These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with These fantastic party favors little plastic toys and These fantastic party favors flimsy paper hats inside.
----------------------------------------------
I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into Yeh beard.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
----------------------------------------------
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled People as People moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Dursleys
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
The Dursleys got into bed.
----------------------------------------------
It was on they news.” a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes jerked a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; The sun crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as The sun had been on the night when Mrs. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.
----------------------------------------------
“And don’t ask questions.” Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t be silly, Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon hates a large blond boy.” the Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though Harry wasn’t there — or rather, as though Harry was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.
----------------------------------------------
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe Dudley’s luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley’s, on the way to the zoo for the first time in Dudley’s life.
----------------------------------------------
The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and The problem was just no good telling the Dursleys Harry didn’t make the Dursleys happen.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys had received a very angry letter from his money’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.
----------------------------------------------
If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than Harry asking questions, it was Harry talking about anything acting in a way the Dursleys shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think Harry might get dangerous ideas.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what Harry wanted before they could hurry Harry away, they bought Harry a cheap lemon ice pop.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley’s and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on the animals favorite hobby of hitting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know what time it was and Harry couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as Harry could remember, ever since Harry’d been a baby and Harry parents had died in that car crash.
----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
silently mustn’t wake the Dursleys.
----------------------------------------------
The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one — “Out!
----------------------------------------------
Of course, Uncle Vernon birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given Uncle Vernon a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old socks.
----------------------------------------------
Harry lay and watched Harry birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
----------------------------------------------
“Anyway Harry,” said A giant of a man, turning Harry back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to Yeh.
----------------------------------------------
“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys were cowering against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you mean ter tell me,” Yeh growled at the Dursleys, “that Yeh — Yeh!
----------------------------------------------
You told me they died in a car crash!” “CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to they corner.
----------------------------------------------
Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell Yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” ta threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped; Harry had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.
----------------------------------------------
Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?
----------------------------------------------
If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, Harry hadmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told Harry so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had The Dursleys from ’dfaster than blinking.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys.
----------------------------------------------
But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.” Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take Harry back to the Dursleys, then handed Harry an envelope.
----------------------------------------------
Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me.
----------------------------------------------
See yeh soon, Harry.” the train that would take him back to the Dursleys pulled out of Paddington station.
----------------------------------------------
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun.
----------------------------------------------
Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.
----------------------------------------------
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
----------------------------------------------
Harryturned and saw the Dursleys drive away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that Harry had pockets rattling with gold and silver Harry was ready to buy Mars Bars as Harry could carry — but a smiling, dimpled woman didn’t have Mars Bars.
----------------------------------------------
The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when Harry’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that Harry’d somehow turned Harry teachers wig blue.
----------------------------------------------
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but The Dursleys’d never been allowed to eat as much as The Dursleys liked.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
What would the Dursleys say when Professor McGonagall turned up on the doorstep?
----------------------------------------------
These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with These fantastic party favors little plastic toys and These fantastic party favors flimsy paper hats inside.
----------------------------------------------
If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side!
----------------------------------------------

*************************************************
Albus Dumbledore
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
A man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that Albus Dumbledore had just arrived in a street where everything from Albus Dumbledore name to Albus Dumbledore boots was unwelcome.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore was busy rummaging in Albus Dumbledore cloak, looking for something.
----------------------------------------------
But Albus Dumbledore did seem to realize Albus Dumbledore was being watched, because Albus Dumbledore looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at Albus Dumbledore from the other end of the street.
----------------------------------------------
For some reason, the sight of the cat on the wall outside seemed to amuse Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.” Albus Dumbledore found what Albus Dumbledore was looking for in Albus Dumbledore inside pocket.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore flicked It open, held It up in the air, and clicked It.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore clicked The nearest street lamp again — the next lamp flickered into darkness.
----------------------------------------------
Twelve times Albus Dumbledore clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore slipped the Put- Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where Albus Dumbledore sat down on the wall next to the cat on the wall outside.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore didn’t look at the cat on the wall outside, but after a moment Albus Dumbledore spoke to the cat on the wall outside.
----------------------------------------------
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” Albus Dumbledore turned to smile at the tabby, but the tabby had gone.
----------------------------------------------
Instead Albus Dumbledore was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat on the wall outside had had around the cat on the wall outside eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle never had much sense.” “You can’t blame them,” said Albus Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.” She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Albus Dumbledore here, as though hoping Albus Dumbledore was going to tell She something, but Albus Dumbledore didn’t, so She went on.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose Albus Dumbledore really has gone, Albus Dumbledore?” “It certainly seems so,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone knows you’re the only one You- Know- oh, all right, Voldemort , was frightened of.” “You flatter me,” said Albus Dumbledore calmly.
----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
About what finally stopped he?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall did now.
----------------------------------------------
It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.
----------------------------------------------
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that Lily and James Potter are —’re — dead.” Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head.
----------------------------------------------
Oh, Albus ...” Albus Dumbledore reached out and patted Albus Dumbledore on the shoulder.
----------------------------------------------
I know ...” Albus Dumbledore said heavily.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying Albus Dumbledore tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
But — Albus Dumbledore couldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill that little boy.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
“After all Albus Dumbledore’s done ...
----------------------------------------------
all the people Albus Dumbledore’s killed ...
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill a little boy?
----------------------------------------------
of all the things to stop Albus Dumbledore .
----------------------------------------------
but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?” “We can only guess,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore gave a great sniff as Albus Dumbledore took a golden watch from Albus Dumbledore pocket and examined a golden watch from his pocket.
----------------------------------------------
It must have made sense to Albus Dumbledore, though, because Albus Dumbledore put It back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be here, by the way?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledore — you can’t.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter come and live here!” “It’s the best place for him,” said Albus Dumbledore firmly.
----------------------------------------------
“his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to Albus Dumbledore when Albus Dumbledore’s older.
----------------------------------------------
“Really, Albus Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?
----------------------------------------------
These people will never understand Albus Dumbledore!
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s bringing Albus Dumbledore.” “You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid,” said Albus Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Hell have that scar forever.” “Couldn’t you do something about it, Albus Dumbledore?” “Even if I could, I wouldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked a letterinside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
“Well,” said Albus Dumbledore finally, “that’s that.
----------------------------------------------
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Albus Dumbledore, nodding to Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.
----------------------------------------------
On the corner Albus Dumbledore stopped and took out the silver Put- Outer.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore clicked the silver Put- Outer once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and Albus Dumbledore could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
----------------------------------------------
“Good luck, Harry,” Albus Dumbledore murmured.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore turned on Albus Dumbledore heel and with a swish of his cloak, Albus Dumbledore was gone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.
----------------------------------------------
Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“So this is Albus Dumbledore!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Albus Dumbledore!” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry astonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledoregone!” “Well, you can’t expect Albus Dumbledore to hang around all day,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledore’ll be back.
----------------------------------------------
“Weird).” Harry stared as Albus Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on Harry card and gave Harry a small smile.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Albus Dumbledore was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad.
----------------------------------------------
And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry recognized Albus Dumbledore at once from the card Albus Dumbledore’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to Albus Dumbledore feet.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore was beaming at the students, Albus Dumbledore arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased Albus Dumbledore more than to see them all there.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome!” Albus Dumbledore said.
----------------------------------------------
“Thank you!” Albus Dumbledore sat back down.
----------------------------------------------
Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Albus Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that Harry was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above Albus Dumbledore swam.
----------------------------------------------

Albus Dumbledore didn’t look at the cat on the wall outside, but after a moment Albus Dumbledore spoke to the cat on the wall outside.
----------------------------------------------
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” Albus Dumbledore turned to smile at the tabby, but the tabby had gone.
----------------------------------------------
Instead Albus Dumbledore was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat on the wall outside had had around the cat on the wall outside eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle never had much sense.” “You can’t blame them,” said Albus Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.” She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Albus Dumbledore here, as though hoping Albus Dumbledore was going to tell She something, but Albus Dumbledore didn’t, so She went on.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose Albus Dumbledore really has gone, Albus Dumbledore?” “It certainly seems so,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
All this You- Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: Voldemort .” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone knows you’re the only one You- Know- oh, all right, Voldemort , was frightened of.” “You flatter me,” said Albus Dumbledore calmly.
----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
About what finally stopped he?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall did now.
----------------------------------------------
It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.
----------------------------------------------
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that Lily and James Potter are —’re — dead.” Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head.
----------------------------------------------
Oh, Albus ...” Albus Dumbledore reached out and patted Albus Dumbledore on the shoulder.
----------------------------------------------
I know ...” Albus Dumbledore said heavily.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying Albus Dumbledore tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
But — Albus Dumbledore couldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill that little boy.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
“After all Albus Dumbledore’s done ...
----------------------------------------------
all the people Albus Dumbledore’s killed ...
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill a little boy?
----------------------------------------------
of all the things to stop Albus Dumbledore .
----------------------------------------------
but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?” “We can only guess,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore gave a great sniff as Albus Dumbledore took a golden watch from Albus Dumbledore pocket and examined a golden watch from his pocket.
----------------------------------------------
It must have made sense to Albus Dumbledore, though, because Albus Dumbledore put It back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be here, by the way?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledore — you can’t.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter come and live here!” “It’s the best place for him,” said Albus Dumbledore firmly.
----------------------------------------------
“his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to Albus Dumbledore when Albus Dumbledore’s older.
----------------------------------------------
“Really, Albus Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?
----------------------------------------------
These people will never understand Albus Dumbledore!
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s bringing Albus Dumbledore.” “You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid,” said Albus Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
----------------------------------------------
And where did you get a huge motorcycle?” “Borrowed a huge motorcycle, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said a huge motorcycle, climbing carefully off a huge motorcycle as he spoke.
----------------------------------------------
Young Sirius Black fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Hell have that scar forever.” “Couldn’t you do something about it, Albus Dumbledore?” “Even if I could, I wouldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked a letterinside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
“Well,” said Albus Dumbledore finally, “that’s that.
----------------------------------------------
G ’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Wiping Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” streaming eyes on Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” jacket sleeve, Hagridswung Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar the engine rose into the air and off into the night.
----------------------------------------------
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Albus Dumbledore, nodding to Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.
----------------------------------------------
On the corner Albus Dumbledore stopped and took out the silver Put- Outer.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore clicked the silver Put- Outer once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and Albus Dumbledore could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
----------------------------------------------
“Good luck, Harry,” Albus Dumbledore murmured.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore turned on Albus Dumbledore heel and with a swish of his cloak, Albus Dumbledore was gone.
----------------------------------------------
Never told A braver man than Vernon Dursley what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him?
----------------------------------------------
I saw Dumbledore leave fer him, Vernon Dursley!
----------------------------------------------
An’ you’ve kept fer him from Dumbledore all these years?” “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
“I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of Yeh, how much yeh didn’t know.
----------------------------------------------
Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of.
----------------------------------------------
probably knew they were too close ter Reckon Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.
----------------------------------------------
“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------
But DUMBLEDORE let me stay on as gamekeeper.
----------------------------------------------
Great man, Dumbledore.” “Why were you expelled?” “It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly.
----------------------------------------------
As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“They wanted DUMBLEDORE fer Minister, o’ course, but Dumbledore fer ’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.
----------------------------------------------
So Dumbledore fer pelts DUMBLEDORE with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.” “But what does a Ministry of Magic Ministry of Magic Magic do?” “Well, their main job is to keep their main job from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.” “Why?” “Why?
----------------------------------------------
Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out Hagrid chest.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.” The goblin read a letter here from Professor Dumbledore carefully.
----------------------------------------------
Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“So this is Albus Dumbledore!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Albus Dumbledore!” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry astonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledoregone!” “Well, you can’t expect Albus Dumbledore to hang around all day,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledore’ll be back.
----------------------------------------------
“Weird).” Harry stared as Albus Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on Harry card and gave Harry a small smile.
----------------------------------------------
Soon Harry had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Albus Dumbledore was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad.
----------------------------------------------
And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry recognized Albus Dumbledore at once from the card Albus Dumbledore’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to Albus Dumbledore feet.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore was beaming at the students, Albus Dumbledore arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased Albus Dumbledore more than to see them all there.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome!” Albus Dumbledore said.
----------------------------------------------
“Thank you!” Albus Dumbledore sat back down.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagallwas talking to Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Quirrellgot to Professor Dumbledore again.
----------------------------------------------
And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
----------------------------------------------
“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
I do think he’s the Slytherin ghost might have told us prefects, at least.” “And now, before us go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore gave Professor Dumbledore wand a little flick, as if Professor Dumbledore was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of he was , which rose high above the tables and twisted he was , snakelike, into words.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore conducted only the Weasley twins last few lines with his wand and when only the Weasley twins had finished, Professor Dumbledore was one of those who clapped loudest.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, music,” Professor Dumbledore said, wiping Professor Dumbledore eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe Hermione Granger’s was taking Professor McGonagall to Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Light — speedy — we’ll have to get Harry a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone stared as Harry reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” Harry then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
----------------------------------------------
an uproar took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this.
----------------------------------------------
“I know Harry’s not very nice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“ Fluffy ?” “Yeah — bought off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent to Dumbledore to guard the — ” “Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
You forget that dog, an’ you forget what His broom’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” “Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?” Hagrid looked furious with Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped Dumbledore pointed wizardRon’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read Professor Flitwick.
----------------------------------------------
Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Albus Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that Harry was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
whatever us want ...” “Yes and no,” said Dumbledore gently quietly.
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore gently?
----------------------------------------------
Can I ask you something?” “Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore gently smiled.
----------------------------------------------
I see Dumbledore gently holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
People will insist on giving me books.” It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore gently might not have been quite truthful.
----------------------------------------------
NICHOLAS FLAMBL Dumbledore gently had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays an Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of Dumbledore gently trunk.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore gently again,” Dumbledore gently said, “Dumbledore gently was the first one I ever — ” Dumbledore gently gasped.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore gently stared at the back of the card.
----------------------------------------------
Then Dumbledore gently looked up at Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve found him\” Dumbledore gently whispered.
----------------------------------------------
I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read the name on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore gently is particularly famous for Dumbledore gently defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ Hermione jumped to Hermione .
----------------------------------------------
I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep it safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew someone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore gentlyDumbledore gently?” Dumbledore gently said, dashing to the door to make sure.
----------------------------------------------
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt Harry if Dumbledore gently was watching.
----------------------------------------------
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
----------------------------------------------
“Well done,” said Dumbledore gently quietly, so that Harry Harry could hear.
----------------------------------------------
“We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help Dumbledore, apart from Dumbledore.” Hagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore borrowed Fluffy from Dumbledore ...
----------------------------------------------
Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore ticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course.
----------------------------------------------
Not even one of the teachers?” “Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Hagrid proudly.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycould go to Dumbledore at any moment.” Hagrid bit Hagrid lip.
----------------------------------------------
“Go to Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
It’s not exactly a secret we hate Snape, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it up to get Dumbledore sacked.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of.
----------------------------------------------
With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you.
----------------------------------------------
HarryHarry, relax, Hermione ’s right, The unicorn’s dead safe as long as Dumbledore’s around.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I just hope Dumbledore believes us.
----------------------------------------------
Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing They in the right direction.
----------------------------------------------
They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did They know anyone who had been sent to see Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“us want to see Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Harry thought.
----------------------------------------------
“See Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly.
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “DumbledoreThe unicorn’s dead gone?” said Harry frantically.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got to talk to Dumbledore.” Professor McGonagall eyed Dumbledore with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall said finally.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.” “But what can we — ” Hermione gasped.
----------------------------------------------
Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for Dumbledore, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at Harry scar.
----------------------------------------------
I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore watching.
----------------------------------------------
“Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this .
----------------------------------------------
“I see Harry shaking hands with Dumbledore,” Dumbledore invented.
----------------------------------------------
“Get out of the way,” Dumbledore said.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry moved aside, Dumbledore felt the Stone against Dumbledore leg.
----------------------------------------------
Dare Dumbledore make a break for it?
----------------------------------------------
But Dumbledore hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving Dumbledore lips.
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore lies ...
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore lies ...” Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted.
----------------------------------------------
“Let me speak to Dumbledore ...
----------------------------------------------
The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above Albus Dumbledore swam.
----------------------------------------------
“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Sir, quick — “Calm yourself, Harry Potter, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming.
----------------------------------------------
“But your friend — Nicolas Flamel — ” “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.
----------------------------------------------
Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” “But that means Nicolas and Nicolas wife will die, won’t he and his wife?” “he and his wife have enough Elixir stored to set he and his wife affairs in order and then, yes, he and his wife will die.” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
...” “the truth.” Dumbledore sighed.
----------------------------------------------
But why would Lord Voldemort want to kill me in the first place?” Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
----------------------------------------------
It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.” Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry Harry eyes on the sheet.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry had found Harry voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent his voice to me?” “Ah — your father happened to leave his voice in my possession, and I thought you might like his voice.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
And then, Dumbledore did something Snape could never forgive.” “What?” “Snape saved Snape life.” “What?” “Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape could go back to hating Dumbledore’s memory in peace.
----------------------------------------------
“Absolutely not.” “You let Dumbledore Dumbledore in.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so worried — ” “The whole school’s talking about The whole school’s,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s just going to die?” “That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it?
----------------------------------------------
— ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’ ” “I always said Dumbledore was off Dumbledore rocker,” said Ron and Hermionelooking quite impressed at how crazy Dumbledore hero was.
----------------------------------------------
“I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met Dumbledore in the entrance hall — Dumbledore already knew — Dumbledore just said, ‘Harry’s gone after Harry, hasn’t Harry?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” “D’you think “D’you meant you to do “D’you?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
““D’you’s a funny man, Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
...” “Yeah, Dumbledore’s off Dumbledore rocker, all right,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I can, can’t I?” “Dumbledore Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” Madam Pomfrey said sniffily, as though in Madam Pomfrey opinion Dumbledore Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts could be.
----------------------------------------------
“Who is it?” Hagrid sidled through the door as Dumbledore spoke.
----------------------------------------------
As usual when Dumbledore was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore sat down next to Harry, took one look at Dumbledore, and burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” Dumbledore sobbed, Dumbledore face in Dumbledore hands.
----------------------------------------------
I told Dumbledore!
----------------------------------------------
It was the only thing Dumbledore didn’t know, an’ I told Dumbledore!
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix yesterday ter .
----------------------------------------------
’Course, Dumbledore shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got y eh this ...” this seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book.
----------------------------------------------
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later.
----------------------------------------------
“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Ahem,” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Those who could add up while yelling themselves had tied for the House Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore raised Dumbledore hand.
----------------------------------------------
“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
----------------------------------------------
“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little change of decoration.” He clapped He .
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Professor McGonagall
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” Albus Dumbledore turned to smile at the tabby, but the tabby had gone.
----------------------------------------------
“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” “You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.” Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.
----------------------------------------------
We’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.” “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though Professor McGonagall didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops.
----------------------------------------------
All this You- Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: Voldemort .” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
----------------------------------------------
“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort ’s name.” “I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.
----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
About what finally stopped he?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall did now.
----------------------------------------------
It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true.
----------------------------------------------
“What they’re saying,” Professor McGonagall pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall gasped.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying Albus Dumbledore tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s — It’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“We may never know.” Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at Professor McGonagall eyes beneath Professor McGonagall spectacles.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be here, by the way?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“’re the only family Harry has left now.” “You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to Professor McGonagall Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve written his aunt and uncle a letter.” “A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?” Professor McGonagall opened Professor McGonagall mouth, changed Professor McGonagall mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m not saying the boy heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend the boy’s not careless.
----------------------------------------------
Young Sirius Black fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.
----------------------------------------------
“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying sir face in Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
G ’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Wiping Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” streaming eyes on Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” jacket sleeve, Hagridswung Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar the engine rose into the air and off into the night.
----------------------------------------------
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Albus Dumbledore, nodding to Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall blew Professor McGonagall nose in reply.
----------------------------------------------
“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid’s.
----------------------------------------------
flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Please wait quietly.” Professor McGonagall left the chamber.
----------------------------------------------
Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead Professor McGonagall to Professor McGonagall doom.
----------------------------------------------
Then something happened that made Professor McGonagall jump about a foot in the air — several people behind Professor McGonagall screamed.
----------------------------------------------
“What the — ?” Professor McGonagall gasped.
----------------------------------------------
So did the people around Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.” Professor McGonagall had returned.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind the other students.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
----------------------------------------------
“When I call your name, you will put on a pointed wizard’s hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” Professor McGonagall said.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall rolled up Professor McGonagall scroll and took a pointed wizard’s hat away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was running toward them.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall got to Professor McGonagall feet, trembling.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at Professor McGonagall; Professor McGonagall had to jog to keep up.
----------------------------------------------
Now Professor McGonagall’d done it.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall hadn’t even lasted two weeks.
----------------------------------------------
He’d be packing Professor McGonagall bags in ten minutes.
----------------------------------------------
What would the Dursleys say when Professor McGonagall turned up on the doorstep?
----------------------------------------------
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe Hermione Granger’s was taking Professor McGonagall to Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps Professor McGonagall could be Hermione Granger’s assistant.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall stomach twisted as Professor McGonagall imagined it, watching Ronand the others becoming wizards while Professor McGonagall stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall opened the door and poked Professor McGonagall head inside.
----------------------------------------------
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane Professor McGonagall was going to use on Harry?
----------------------------------------------
“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“In here.” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall pointed they into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
----------------------------------------------
“Out, Peeves!” Professor McGonagall barked.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind Professor McGonagall and turned to face the two boys.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you serious, Professor ?” “Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall crisply.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood .
----------------------------------------------
“Didn’t even scratch Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall explained.
----------------------------------------------
...” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over Professor McGonagall glasses at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to hear you’re training hard, Harry Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.” Then Professor McGonagall suddenly smiled.
----------------------------------------------
“Your father would have been proud,” Professor McGonagall said.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had just finished telling Ronwhat had happened when Harry’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the whole room , closely followed by Snape, with Professor Quirrell bringing up the rear.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was looking at Neville and Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall look so angry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall lips were white.
----------------------------------------------
“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in Professor voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” Hermione had managed to get to his feet at last.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall .
----------------------------------------------
“I’m very disappointed in Professor McGonagall .
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating — ” “Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.
----------------------------------------------
“Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.” So the three of them followed Hagrid and Hagrid tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
Neville said Neville’d been looking for someone to practice that on.” “Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore ticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.
----------------------------------------------
Filch took Things down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor, where Things sat and waited without saying a word to each other.
----------------------------------------------
There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes.
----------------------------------------------
When Professor McGonagallappeared, Professor McGonagall was leading Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.
----------------------------------------------
It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” The sky had turned light before they stopped talking.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall watched they turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if the snuffbox had whiskers.
----------------------------------------------
“What are you three doing inside?” It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.
----------------------------------------------
“See Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
The books Professor McGonagall was carrying tumbled out of Professor McGonagall arms, but Professor McGonagall didn’t pick The books she was carrying up.
----------------------------------------------
“How do you know — ?” Professor McGonagall spluttered.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got to talk to Dumbledore.” Professor McGonagall eyed Dumbledore with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall said finally.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal no one, no one’s too well protected.” “But Professor — ” “Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” Professor McGonagall said shortly.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall bent down and gathered up the fallen books.
----------------------------------------------
No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, Professor McGonagall lost Professor McGonagall temper.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” Professor McGonagall stormed.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m sorry, Harry!” Professor McGonagall wailed.
----------------------------------------------
“After what Professor McGonagall and Snape have said?
----------------------------------------------
Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Professor
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” Albus Dumbledore turned to smile at the tabby, but the tabby had gone.
----------------------------------------------
“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” “You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.” Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.
----------------------------------------------
We’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.” “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though Professor McGonagall didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops.
----------------------------------------------
“As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone — ” “My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself name?
----------------------------------------------
All this You- Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: Voldemort .” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
----------------------------------------------
“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort ’s name.” “I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.
----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
About what finally stopped he?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall did now.
----------------------------------------------
It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true.
----------------------------------------------
“What they’re saying,” Professor McGonagall pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall gasped.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying Albus Dumbledore tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s — It’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“We may never know.” Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at Professor McGonagall eyes beneath Professor McGonagall spectacles.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be here, by the way?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“’re the only family Harry has left now.” “You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to Professor McGonagall Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve written his aunt and uncle a letter.” “A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?” Professor McGonagall opened Professor McGonagall mouth, changed Professor McGonagall mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m not saying the boy heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend the boy’s not careless.
----------------------------------------------
And where did you get a huge motorcycle?” “Borrowed a huge motorcycle, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said a huge motorcycle, climbing carefully off a huge motorcycle as he spoke.
----------------------------------------------
Young Sirius Black fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.
----------------------------------------------
“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying sir face in Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
G ’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Wiping Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” streaming eyes on Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” jacket sleeve, Hagridswung Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar the engine rose into the air and off into the night.
----------------------------------------------
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Albus Dumbledore, nodding to Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall blew Professor McGonagall nose in reply.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
“N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” “Professor Quirrell laughed nervously.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- book on vampires, m-myself.” “Professor Quirrell looked terrified at the very thought.
----------------------------------------------
But the others wouldn’t let “Professor Quirrell keep Harry to “Professor Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind ’s usually tremblin’.” “Is Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind always that nervous?” “Oh, yeah.
----------------------------------------------
Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind was fine while Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind was studyin’ outta books but then Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.
----------------------------------------------
They say Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since.
----------------------------------------------
Scared of the students, scared of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?” Vampires?
----------------------------------------------
two across ...” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind muttered.
----------------------------------------------
“Right, stand back, Harry.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind tapped the wall above the trash can three times with the point of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind umbrella.
----------------------------------------------
The brick Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind had touched quivered — The brick he had touched wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — The brick he had touched grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind grinned at Harry’s amazement.
----------------------------------------------
“That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out Hagrid chest.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.” The goblin read a letter here from Professor Dumbledore carefully.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledoretrusted me.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t stop stammering Harry thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
“All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ...
----------------------------------------------
“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid’s.
----------------------------------------------
flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Please wait quietly.” Professor McGonagall left the chamber.
----------------------------------------------
Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead Professor McGonagall to Professor McGonagall doom.
----------------------------------------------
Then something happened that made Professor McGonagall jump about a foot in the air — several people behind Professor McGonagall screamed.
----------------------------------------------
“What the — ?” Professor McGonagall gasped.
----------------------------------------------
So did the people around Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.” Professor McGonagall had returned.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind the other students.
----------------------------------------------
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
----------------------------------------------
“When I call your name, you will put on a pointed wizard’s hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” Professor McGonagall said.
----------------------------------------------
What if Harry just sat there with the hat over Harry eyes for ages, until Professor jerked it off Harry head and said there had obviously been a mistake and Harry’d better get back on the train?
----------------------------------------------
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall rolled up Professor McGonagall scroll and took a pointed wizard’s hat away.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagallwas talking to Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Quirrell, in Professor Quirrell absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
----------------------------------------------
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Quirrellgot to Professor Dumbledore again.
----------------------------------------------
“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
I do think he’s the Slytherin ghost might have told us prefects, at least.” “And now, before us go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore gave Professor Dumbledore wand a little flick, as if Professor Dumbledore was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of he was , which rose high above the tables and twisted he was , snakelike, into words.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore conducted only the Weasley twins last few lines with his wand and when only the Weasley twins had finished, Professor Dumbledore was one of those who clapped loudest.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, music,” Professor Dumbledore said, wiping Professor Dumbledore eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch wouldn’t believe Harry and Ron were lost, was sure Harry and Ron were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock Harry and Ron in the dungeons when Harry and Ron were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.
----------------------------------------------
Three times a week They went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where They learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what They were used for.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns had been very old indeed when Professor Binns had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving Professor Binns body behind Professor Binns.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binnsdroned on and on while They scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns was again different.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been quite right to think Professor Binns wasn’t a teacher to cross.
----------------------------------------------
Strict and clever, Professor Binns gave cross a talking- to the moment cross sat down in Professor Binns first class.
----------------------------------------------
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” Professor Binns said.
----------------------------------------------
You have been warned.” Then Professor Binns changed his desk into a pig and back again.
----------------------------------------------
By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to only Hermione Granger match; Professor Binns showed my class how my class had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns was head of Gryffindor House, but Professor Binns hadn’t stopped Professor Binns from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
----------------------------------------------
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape didn’t dislike Harry — Professor Snape hated Harry —.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, Professor Snape paused at Harry’s name.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, yes,” Professor Snape said softly, “Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but warmth caught every word — like Professor Binns, Professor Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter!” said Professor Snape suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was still ignoring ’s quivering hand.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape, however, was not pleased.
----------------------------------------------
“Sit down,” Professor Snape snapped at Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape put them all into pairs and set pairs to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed Professor Snape horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
“Idiot boy!” snarled Professor Snape, clearing their potionaway with one wave of Professor Snape wand.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” Professor Snape whimpered as boils started to pop up all over Professor Snape nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Take Professor Snape up to the hospital wing,” Professor Snape spat at Seamus.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in Harry’s very first week — why did Professor Snape hate Professor Snape so much?
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid , like RonRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Professor Snapeliked hardly any of the students.
----------------------------------------------
“But Professor Snape seemed to really hate me.” “Rubbish!” said Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had never been on a broomstick in Professor Snape life, because Professor Snape grandmother had never let Professor Snape near one.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Professor Snape was.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
----------------------------------------------
A barn owl brought Professor Snape a small package from Professor Snape grandmother.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape opened a small package from his grandmother excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
----------------------------------------------
“a small package from his grandmother’s the Remembrall!” Professor Snape explained.
----------------------------------------------
Look, you hold it tight like this and if this turns red — oh ...” Professor Snape face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “...
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s going on?” “Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrallback on the table.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as white as Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was running toward them.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall got to Professor McGonagall feet, trembling.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at Professor McGonagall; Professor McGonagall had to jog to keep up.
----------------------------------------------
Now Professor McGonagall’d done it.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall hadn’t even lasted two weeks.
----------------------------------------------
He’d be packing Professor McGonagall bags in ten minutes.
----------------------------------------------
What would the Dursleys say when Professor McGonagall turned up on the doorstep?
----------------------------------------------
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe Hermione Granger’s was taking Professor McGonagall to Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps Professor McGonagall could be Hermione Granger’s assistant.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall stomach twisted as Professor McGonagall imagined it, watching Ronand the others becoming wizards while Professor McGonagall stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall opened the door and poked Professor McGonagall head inside.
----------------------------------------------
“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?Wood ?
----------------------------------------------
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane Professor McGonagall was going to use on Harry?
----------------------------------------------
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Professor Flitwick’s class looking confused.
----------------------------------------------
“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“In here.” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall pointed they into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
----------------------------------------------
“Out, Peeves!” Professor McGonagall barked.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind Professor McGonagall and turned to face the two boys.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you serious, Professor ?” “Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall crisply.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood .
----------------------------------------------
“Didn’t even scratch Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall explained.
----------------------------------------------
“Light — speedy — we’ll have to get Harry a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule.
----------------------------------------------
...” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over Professor McGonagall glasses at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to hear you’re training hard, Harry Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.” Then Professor McGonagall suddenly smiled.
----------------------------------------------
“Your father would have been proud,” Professor McGonagall said.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had just finished telling Ronwhat had happened when Harry’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at HALLOWEEN Malfoy’s elbow.
----------------------------------------------
“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said HALLOWEEN Malfoy quickly.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Flitwick told me all about the special circumstances, Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that Professor Flitwick thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen Professor Flitwick make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of Professor Flitwick pile of books as usual.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone stared as Harry reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” Harry then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
----------------------------------------------
an uproar took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.
----------------------------------------------
A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the whole room , closely followed by Snape, with Professor Quirrell bringing up the rear.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Quirrell took one look at even a troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was looking at Neville and Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall look so angry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall lips were white.
----------------------------------------------
“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in Professor voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” Hermione had managed to get to his feet at last.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall .
----------------------------------------------
“I’m very disappointed in Professor McGonagall .
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating — ” “Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Higgs — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” the Slytherins were cheering.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
You forget that dog, an’ you forget what His broom’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” “Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?” Hagrid looked furious with Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.
----------------------------------------------
“Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.” So the three of them followed Hagrid and Hagrid tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.
----------------------------------------------
“And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
----------------------------------------------
Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped Dumbledore pointed wizardRon’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read Professor Flitwick.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” Harry felt the blood drain out of Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Neville said Neville’d been looking for someone to practice that on.” “Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore ticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.
----------------------------------------------
Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you — ” “You don’t understand, Professor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter’s coming — Professor’s got a dragon!” “What utter rubbish!
----------------------------------------------
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
----------------------------------------------
Filch took Things down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor, where Things sat and waited without saying a word to each other.
----------------------------------------------
There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes.
----------------------------------------------
When Professor McGonagallappeared, Professor McGonagall was leading Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor — please — ” “You can’t—” “Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Harry Potter’s .
----------------------------------------------
It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” The sky had turned light before they stopped talking.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Flitwick called they one by one into Professor Flitwick class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall watched they turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if the snuffbox had whiskers.
----------------------------------------------
When the ghost of Professor Binns told they to put down they quills and roll up they parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest.
----------------------------------------------
“What are you three doing inside?” It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.
----------------------------------------------
“See Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
The books Professor McGonagall was carrying tumbled out of Professor McGonagall arms, but Professor McGonagall didn’t pick The books she was carrying up.
----------------------------------------------
“How do you know — ?” Professor McGonagall spluttered.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got to talk to Dumbledore.” Professor McGonagall eyed Dumbledore with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall said finally.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal no one, no one’s too well protected.” “But Professor — ” “Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” Professor McGonagall said shortly.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall bent down and gathered up the fallen books.
----------------------------------------------
“You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” Harry put on a high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong.
----------------------------------------------
No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, Professor McGonagall lost Professor McGonagall temper.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” Professor McGonagall stormed.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m sorry, Harry!” Professor McGonagall wailed.
----------------------------------------------
“After what Professor McGonagall and Snape have said?
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Flitwicktold me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on Professor Flitwick exam.
----------------------------------------------
what did Professor Sprout say?
----------------------------------------------
Next to Severus, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?Harry Harry couldn’t take it in.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Is that true?” “Well, Professor Snape did rather detest each other.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in DumbledoreHarry’s debt.
----------------------------------------------
I do believe Professor Snape worked so hard to protect you this year because Professor Snape felt that would make Professor Snape and your father even.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape could go back to hating Dumbledore’s memory in peace.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Voldemort
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
All this You- Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: Voldemort .” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
----------------------------------------------
“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort ’s name.” “I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone knows you’re the only one You- Know- oh, all right, Voldemort , was frightened of.” “You flatter me,” said Albus Dumbledore calmly.
----------------------------------------------
“Voldemort had powers I will never have.” “Only because you’re too — well — noble to use Only because you’re too.” “It’s lucky It’s dark.
----------------------------------------------
“What they’re saying,” Professor McGonagall pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow.
----------------------------------------------
last night Voldemort went to find the Potters.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
All right — Voldemort.” Hagridshuddered.
----------------------------------------------
and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort — ” Ron gasped.
----------------------------------------------
Harry supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but this had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ...
----------------------------------------------
...” “Stop saying the name!” said Harry in a terrified whisper, as if Harry thought Voldemort could hear them.
----------------------------------------------
Banethinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.
----------------------------------------------
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.
----------------------------------------------
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how Harry had managed to get through Harry exams when Harry half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of Voldemort certainly scared The idea of Voldemort, but The idea of Voldemort didn’t keep visiting The idea of Voldemort in dreams, and The idea of Voldemort were so busy with The idea of Voldemort studying The idea of Voldemort didn’t have much time to fret about what “Snape or anyone else might be up to.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of Voldemort very last exam was History of Magic.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk.
----------------------------------------------
If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back!
----------------------------------------------
If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side!
----------------------------------------------
Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” Voldemort glared at my parents.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t even Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
Tried to frighten me — as though Snape could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was.
----------------------------------------------
Since then, I have served Lord Voldemort faithfully, although I have let Lord Voldemort down many times.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
“Lord Voldemort does not forgive mistakes easily.
----------------------------------------------
When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, Lord Voldemort was most displeased.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort punished me .
----------------------------------------------
decided Lord Voldemort would have to keep a closer watch on me.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was walking backward at Harry, so that Voldemort could still see Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Now give me the Stone, unless you want your mother to have died in vain.” “NEVER!” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist.
----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
“Then kill Harry, fool, and be done!” screeched Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only hear Harry’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
----------------------------------------------
Sir — even if Harry’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” “Call Sir Voldemort, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort said that Lord Voldemort only killed my mother because my mother tried to stop Lord Voldemort from killing me.
----------------------------------------------
But why would Lord Voldemort want to kill me in the first place?” Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
----------------------------------------------
If there is one thing Lord Voldemort cannot understand, it is love.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort didn’t realize that love as powerful as my mother ’s for you leaves that love as powerful as your mother’s for you own mark.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing Quirrell soul with Lord Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
the mirror’s almost like “D’you thought I had the right to face Lord Voldemort if I could.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, this is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, Yeh’d have found out even if you hadn’t told Yeh.” “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ don’ say the name!” “VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, Harry stopped crying.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Madam Pomfrey
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says Snape’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!
----------------------------------------------
’s didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey — would Madam Pomfrey — recognize a dragon bite?
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey Malfoy wanted to borrow one of my books so Malfoy could come and have a good laugh at Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made Ron, and Hermione leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
----------------------------------------------
“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.
----------------------------------------------
Sir, I — ” Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.” Harry swallowed and looked around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.” “How long have I been in here?” “Three days.
----------------------------------------------
Ear wax!” Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.
----------------------------------------------
Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey ...” “Oh, very well,” Madam Pomfrey said.
----------------------------------------------
“But five minutes only.” And Madam Pomfrey let Ron and Hermione in.
----------------------------------------------
“Harryl” Hermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” again, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry head was still very sore.
----------------------------------------------
The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” Madam Pomfrey said firmly.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to go to the end- of-year feast,” Harry told Madam Pomfrey as Madam Pomfrey straightened Harry many candy boxes.
----------------------------------------------
“I can, can’t I?” “Dumbledore Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” Madam Pomfrey said sniffily, as though in Madam Pomfrey opinion Dumbledore Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts could be.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving Harry one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full.
----------------------------------------------
the Great Hall was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Madam Pomfrey’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.

Harry Potter
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
“’re the only family Harry has left now.” “You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to Professor McGonagall Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter come and live here!” “It’s the best place for him,” said Albus Dumbledore firmly.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter rolled over inside Harry Potter blankets without waking up.
----------------------------------------------
One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was special, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as Mrs. Dursley opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter Aunt Petunia was awake and His Aunt Petunia was His Aunt Petunia shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome back, Harry Potter ..., welcome back.” Harry didn’t know what to say.
----------------------------------------------
“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “So proud, Harry Potter ..., I’m just so proud.” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in Harry excitement.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, now — Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“ Harry Potter,” chorused the red-haired twins .
----------------------------------------------
“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Three boys’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment.
----------------------------------------------
So all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment’s you, is all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment?” “Yes,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Neville, the boy who kept losing Harry Potter toad, sniffed once or twice.
----------------------------------------------
flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts crowded in, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Percy the Prefect got up and shook Harry hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Harry Potter!
----------------------------------------------
We got Harry Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff Harry’d seen earlier.
----------------------------------------------
— all the way down the garden and into the road were all Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.” Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
At the top of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, yes,” Professor Snape said softly, “Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter!” said Professor Snape suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it would go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, “Harry Potter?” Harry forced Harry to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“For your information, “Harry Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful a sleeping potion is known as the Draught of Living Death.
----------------------------------------------
“Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good Malfoy is at Quidditch, but I bet thatSeamus’s all talk.” Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“HARRY POTTER!” Harry heart sank faster than Harry’d just dived.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, this is Wood .
----------------------------------------------
Was that your first time on a broomstick, Harry Potter?” Harry nodded silently.
----------------------------------------------
“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Harry Potter?” Charlie Weasley asked excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to hear you’re training hard, Harry Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.” Then Professor McGonagall suddenly smiled.
----------------------------------------------
“Having a last meal, Harry Potter?
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t allowed Harry Potter.” Ron couldn’t resist it.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Flitwick told me all about the special circumstances, Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter’s coming — Professor’s got a dragon!” “What utter rubbish!
----------------------------------------------
As for you, Harry Potter’s , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor — please — ” “You can’t—” “Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Harry Potter’s .
----------------------------------------------
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost their all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
----------------------------------------------
Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Harry Potter’s , we owe you one!” Only Ron stood by Only Ron.
----------------------------------------------
This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the way.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?” “The Sorcerer’s Stone!
----------------------------------------------
“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter ...” face Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared at Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Sir, quick — “Calm yourself, Harry Potter, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Some of People called: “Bye, Harry!” “See you, Harry Potter!” “Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter!” she squealed.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Hagrid
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
It must have made sense to Albus Dumbledore, though, because Albus Dumbledore put It back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s bringing Albus Dumbledore.” “You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid,” said Albus Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
----------------------------------------------
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying sir face in Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
We may as well go and join the celebrations.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best get this bike away.
----------------------------------------------
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” Harry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
----------------------------------------------
“Call me Hagrid,” Dudley’s said, “everyone does.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid looked shocked.
----------------------------------------------
“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows.
----------------------------------------------
“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered.
----------------------------------------------
“I can, you know, do math and stuff.” But Hagrid simply waved Harry hand and said, “About our world, I mean.
----------------------------------------------
Yer parents’ world.” “What world?” Hagrid looked as if Hagrid was about to explode.
----------------------------------------------
“DURSLEY!” Hagrid boomed.
----------------------------------------------
yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran Hagridfingers through Yeh hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
----------------------------------------------
I forbid you to tell Yeh anything!” A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave A braver man than Vernon Dursley; when Hagrid spoke, A braver man than Vernon Dursley every syllable trembled with rage.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of Yeh,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit.
----------------------------------------------
After a few minutes It’s stammered, “What does it mean, they await your owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to Hagrid forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside Hagrid overcoat Hagrid pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave Hagrid Hagrid to the owl, which clamped Hagrid Hagrid in Hagrid Hagrid beak, went to the door, and threw your owl out into the storm.
----------------------------------------------
“Where was I?” said Hagrid Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid Hagrid grunted.
----------------------------------------------
“A Muggle,” said Hagrid Hagrid, “A Muggle’s what we call nonmagic folk like them.
----------------------------------------------
You told me they died in a car crash!” “CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to they corner.
----------------------------------------------
his anger faded from Hagrid face.
----------------------------------------------
His name was ...” Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
----------------------------------------------
— with a person called — came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew Hagrid nose with a sound like a foghorn.
----------------------------------------------
As Hagrid’s story came to a close, No one saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than No one had ever remembered it before — and No one remembered something else, for the first time in No one life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was watching Hagrid sadly.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was glaring at Hagrid and Uncle Vernon fists were clenched.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, you listen here, boy,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, your parents were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without your parents in my opinion — asked for all your parents got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew your parents’d come to a sticky end — ” But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside Hagrid coat.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
----------------------------------------------
There was somethin’ goin’ on that night Don hadn’t counted on — / dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped Don, all right.” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in Hagrid eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” Dudley said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t think I can be a wizard.” To Dudley surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“See?” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve read those letters and Uncle Vernon needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and — ” “If Uncle Vernon wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop Uncle Vernon,” growled Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------
Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, Uncle Vernon cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind Aunt Petunia and Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked Hagrid beard.
----------------------------------------------
Meant ter turn Hagrid into a pig, but I suppose Hagrid was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” Hagrid cast a sideways look at Harry under Hagrid bushy eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” Hagrid said.
----------------------------------------------
Great man, Dumbledore.” “Why were you expelled?” “It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly.
----------------------------------------------
“I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards.
----------------------------------------------
Tap“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” Harry sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid ’s was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping Hagrid ’s claw on the window, a newspaper held in Hagrid ’s beak.
----------------------------------------------
The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up.
----------------------------------------------
The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t do that.” Harry tried to wave The owl out of the way, but The owlsnapped The owl fiercely at Harry and carried on savaging Hagrid ’s coat.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid ’s!” said Harry loudly.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s an owl — ” “Pay There’s an owl — ” ,” Hagrid ’s grunted into the collapsed sofa.
----------------------------------------------
Look in the pockets.” Hagrid ’s ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ...
----------------------------------------------
“Give Harry five Knuts,” said Hagrid ’s sleepily.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.
----------------------------------------------
“Urn — Hagrid?” “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on Harry huge boots.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.
----------------------------------------------
“D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave Hagrid anything?” “But if their house was destroyed — ” “their didntheir keep their gold in their house, boy!
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything Hagrid want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew Hagrid up proudly.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid usually gets me ter do important stuff fer Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from — knows Hagrid can trust me, see.
----------------------------------------------
Come on, then.” Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock.
----------------------------------------------
“Flew,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got ter .” They settled down in The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine Harry flying.
----------------------------------------------
“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of Harry sideways looks.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid pulled out his umbrella again, tapped Hagrid twice on the side of The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, and they sped off toward land.
----------------------------------------------
“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding Hagrid newspaper as Hagrid spoke.
----------------------------------------------
Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read Harry newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while people did this, but it was very difficult, Harry’d never had so many questions in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
“ ’Course,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid folded up Hagrid newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.
----------------------------------------------
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station.
----------------------------------------------
Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, Harry kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as Muggle called it, gave the bills to Harry so Muggle could buy Hagrid, who didn’t tickets.
----------------------------------------------
“Still got yer letter, Harry?” Hagrid asked as Hagrid counted stitches.
----------------------------------------------
“Good,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Although Hagrid seemed to know where Harry was going, Harry was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was so huge that Hagrid parted the crowd easily; Harry Harry had to do was keep close behind Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, Harry hadmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told Harry so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
If Hagrid hadn’t pointed Hagrid hadn’t out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed Hagrid hadn’t was there.
----------------------------------------------
The people hurrying by didn’t glance at Hagrid hadn’t .
----------------------------------------------
In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only Harry and Hagrid could see it.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could mention this, Hagrid had steered Harry inside.
----------------------------------------------
For a famous place, Hagrid was very dark and shabby.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; waved and smiled at Hagrid, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?” “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping Hagrid great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was beaming.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
At last, Hagrid managed to make Hagrid heard over the babble.
----------------------------------------------
Come on, Harry.” Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.
----------------------------------------------
The brick Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind had touched quivered — The brick he had touched wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — The brick he had touched grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind grinned at Harry’s amazement.
----------------------------------------------
they stepped through an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.” Harry wished Harry had about eight more eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as walked up the white stone steps toward Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob yeh’d,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid and Harrymade for a long counter.
----------------------------------------------
“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.
----------------------------------------------
“That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out Hagrid chest.
----------------------------------------------
“Very well,” The goblin said, handing The goblin back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults.
----------------------------------------------
Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, Hagrid and Harry followed Griphook!” toward one of the doors leading off a vast marble hall.
----------------------------------------------
“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who had expected more marble climbed in Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.
----------------------------------------------
“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of a small cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in Stalagmite’s,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.” did look very green, and when a small cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagridgot out and had to lean against the passage wall to stop Hagrid knees from trembling.
----------------------------------------------
“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of Hagrid into a bag.
----------------------------------------------
They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled Harry back by the scruff of Harry neck.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid picked a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor up and tucked a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor deep inside Hagrid coat.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show Hagrid couldn’t come in.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something a boy with a pale didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid works at Hogwarts.” “Oh,” said a boy with a pale, “I’ve heard of a boy with a pale.
----------------------------------------------
I heard a boy with a pale’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then a boy with a pale gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to a boy with a pale bed.” “I think Hagrid’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s up?” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
When They had left the shop, Harry said, “Hagrid, whatStalagmite’s Quidditch?” “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little Harry know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!” “Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.
----------------------------------------------
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly.
----------------------------------------------
You-Know-Who was one.” “Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find out how to curse even Dudley.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before Harry get ter that level.” Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.
----------------------------------------------
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
----------------------------------------------
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and Hagrid got quickly off the spindly chair.
----------------------------------------------
An old man was standing before them, Hagrid wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of The last shop.
----------------------------------------------
...” Yew shook Yew head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Rubeus Hagrid!
----------------------------------------------
Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” “It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling Hagrid feet.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve still got the pieces, though,” Hagrid added brightly.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly.
----------------------------------------------
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look.
----------------------------------------------
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harryand Hagrid made Harry and Hagrid way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty.
----------------------------------------------
Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where much people were when Hagrid tapped Harry on the shoulder.
----------------------------------------------
Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” Hagrid leaned across the table.
----------------------------------------------
Behind the wild beard and eyebrows Hagrid wore a very kind smile.
----------------------------------------------
But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.” Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take Harry back to the Dursleys, then handed Harry an envelope.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until Harry was out of sight; Harry rose in Harry seat and pressed Harry nose against the window, but Harry blinked and Hagrid had gone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled Hagrid had given Harry out of Harry pocket.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell Harry something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort — ” Ron gasped.
----------------------------------------------
You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” Both Harry and Ron stood up.
----------------------------------------------
All right there, Harry?” Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
----------------------------------------------
Firs’ years follow me!” Slipping and stumbling, ” Slipping and stumbling followed Hagrid’s down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over Hagrid shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” There was a loud “Oooooh!” The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake.
----------------------------------------------
“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid’s called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself.
----------------------------------------------
“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid’s as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent they all heads and the little boats carried they all through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face.
----------------------------------------------
Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of the boats.
----------------------------------------------
Then they all clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the great castle overhead.
----------------------------------------------
You there, still got yer toad?” Hagrid’s raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on front door.
----------------------------------------------
“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid’s.
----------------------------------------------
“Thank you, Hagrid’s.
----------------------------------------------
I will take Hagrid’s from here.” A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes pulled front door wide.
----------------------------------------------
At the end nearest the ghost in the ruff sat Hagrid, who caught the ghost in the ruff eye and gave the ghost in the ruff the thumbs up.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was drinking deeply from Hagrid goblet.
----------------------------------------------
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to Harry so far.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?” At five to three five to three left the main castle and made five to three way across the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest.
----------------------------------------------
Then Hagrid voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry pulled the door open.
----------------------------------------------
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking Ron ears.
----------------------------------------------
Like Hagrid , Fang was clearly not as fierce as Fang looked.
----------------------------------------------
“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
----------------------------------------------
“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles.
----------------------------------------------
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all about Harry and Ron first lessons.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid , like RonRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Professor Snapeliked hardly any of the students.
----------------------------------------------
“But Professor Snape seemed to really hate me.” “Rubbish!” said Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I liked Ron a lot — great with animals.” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
----------------------------------------------
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid !” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
----------------------------------------------
It might’ve been happening while we were there!” There was no doubt about It, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry and Ron walked back to the main castle for dinner, Harry and Ron pockets weighed down with rock cakes Harry and Ron ’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given Harry as much to think about as tea with Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
Had Hagrid collected that grubby little package just in time?
----------------------------------------------
And did Hagrid know something about Snape that Snape didn’t want to tell Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall stomach twisted as Professor McGonagall imagined it, watching Ronand the others becoming wizards while Professor McGonagall stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.
----------------------------------------------
What had Hagrid said?
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
----------------------------------------------
“Budge up there, move along.” “Hagrid!” Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Bin watchin’ from “Bin hut,” said Hagrid , patting a large pair of binoculars around Hagrid neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid , raising Hagrid binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.
----------------------------------------------
“Dunno what Harry thinks Harry’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled.
----------------------------------------------
“Can’t have,Hagrid said, Hagrid voice shaking.
----------------------------------------------
“Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, Hermione started looking frantically at the whole crowd.
----------------------------------------------
Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was cursing your broomstick, muttering, Ron wouldn’t take his eyes off Ron.” “Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to Ron in the stands.
----------------------------------------------
“I found out something about Harry,” Harry told Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
We think Harry was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.” Hagrid dropped the teapot.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s top secret, that is.” “But Snape’s trying to steal That.” “Rubbish,” said Hagrid again.
----------------------------------------------
“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about all !
----------------------------------------------
You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw Snape!” “I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly.
----------------------------------------------
You forget that dog, an’ you forget what His broom’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” “Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?” Hagrid looked furious with Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail could fly off again.
----------------------------------------------
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told Two enormous feet that Hagrid was behind Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking Ron head through the branches.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy was insultin’ Malfoy family.” “Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said Snape silkily.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.” So the three of them followed Hagrid and Hagrid tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?” the Great Hall looked spectacular.
----------------------------------------------
“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked.
----------------------------------------------
“the library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who Harry is.” “You what?” Hagrid looked shocked.
----------------------------------------------
“we must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find Nicolas Flamel anywhere — just give we a hint — I know I’ve read Nicolas Flamel name somewhere.” “I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly.
----------------------------------------------
“Just have to find out for we, then,” said Ron, and Ron, left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let Hagrid slip, because how else were Ron, going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?
----------------------------------------------
the top parcel was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across the top parcel was To Harry, from Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid had obviously whittled it Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?” “I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
“No.” “Why don’t us go down and visit Hagrid?” “No ...
----------------------------------------------
“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet?” “B-b-but Severus, I — ” “You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking a step toward Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until Ron heard Ron say, “Hagrid!
----------------------------------------------
What are you doing in the library?” Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind Ron back.
----------------------------------------------
“And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a the Sorcerer’s Stone’s St — ” “Shhhh\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ go shoutin’ about shoutin, what’s the matter with yeh?” “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” “SHHHH!” said Hagrid again.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid shuffled off.
----------------------------------------------
“What was Hagrid hiding behind Hagrid ?” said Hermione thoughtfully.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think it had anything to do with the Sorcerer’s Stone?” “I’m going to see what section Hagrid was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough of working.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid came back a minute later with a pile of books in Hagrid arms and slammed them down on the table.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!
----------------------------------------------
us kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks, to make Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks forget.” “So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid called “Who is it?” before he let Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks in, and then shut the door quickly behind Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which them refused.
----------------------------------------------
“We were wondering if you could tell We what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy.” Hagrid frowned at Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“O’ course I can’t,” Hagrid said.
----------------------------------------------
Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell We, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid ’s beard twitched and Hagrid ’s beard could tell Hagrid ’s beard was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
“We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help Dumbledore, apart from Dumbledore.” Hagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously.
----------------------------------------------
Not even one of the teachers?” “Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Hagrid proudly.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid, can we have a window open?
----------------------------------------------
I’m boiling.” “Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid — what’s that?” But Harry already knew what it was.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, “That’s — er ...” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
----------------------------------------------
“it must’ve cost you a fortune.” “Won it,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under Hagrid pillow.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” Hermione said.
----------------------------------------------
But Hagrid wasn’t listening.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was humming merrily as Hagrid stoked the fire.
----------------------------------------------
So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out Hagrid was hiding an illegal dragon in Hagrid hut.
----------------------------------------------
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, how many times in our lives are our going to see a dragon hatching?” “our’ve got lessons, our’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone finds out what someone ’s doing — ” “Shut up!” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione argued all the way to Herbologyand in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid greeted Ron, and Hermione, looking flushed and excited.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s nearly out.” Hagrid ushered Ron, and Hermione inside.
----------------------------------------------
“Isn’t A couple of sparks beautiful?” Hagrid murmured.
----------------------------------------------
“Bless A couple of sparks, look, A couple of sparks knows A couple of sparks mommy!” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from Hagrid face — Hagrid leapt to Hagrid feet and ran to the window.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione very nervous spent most of Ron, and Hermione very nervous free time in Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with Hagrid ’s.
----------------------------------------------
“Just let Hagrid ’s go,” Harry urged.
----------------------------------------------
“Set Hagrid ’s free.” “I can’t,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid ’s’s too little.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid hadn’t been doing Hagrid gamekeeping duties because The baby dragon was keeping The baby dragon so busy.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve decided to call The baby dragon Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at The baby dragon with misty eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and ’s going to be as long as your house.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycould go to Dumbledore at any moment.” Hagrid bit Hagrid lip.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I know I can’t keep Hagrid forever, but I can’t jus’ dump Hagrid, can’t.” Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“How about it, Hagrid?” And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to “Charlie to ask “Charlie.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had been down at Hagrid hut, helping Ron feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.
----------------------------------------------
I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for Hagrid to say good-bye to Norbert if Ron, and Hermione hadn’t been so worried about what Ron, and Hermione had to do.
----------------------------------------------
It was a very dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Hagrid in a muffled voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Maybe Snapefound out how to get past Snape without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding asking Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Ahead, Harrycould see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut.
----------------------------------------------
Hurry up, I want ter get started.” Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid relief must have showed in Hagrid face, because Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?
----------------------------------------------
“Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at Fang heel.
----------------------------------------------
All right, Harry, Hermione?” “I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” , Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” ’re here to be punished, after all.” “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry are if Harry want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped Malfoy gaze.
----------------------------------------------
“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks.
----------------------------------------------
“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground?
----------------------------------------------
“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“All right, but I warn yeh, Malfoy’s a coward,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
A little way into The forest they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
----------------------------------------------
“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted Harry and Hermione off the path behind a towering oak.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid pulled out an arrow and fitted an arrow into Hagrid crossbow, raising an arrow, ready to fire.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.
----------------------------------------------
“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said Hagrid grimly.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’s there?” Hagrid called.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
“Were you going to shoot me?” “Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting Ronan crossbow.
----------------------------------------------
“Mars is bright tonight.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too.
----------------------------------------------
“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, Ronan?
----------------------------------------------
Anythin’ unusual?” Mars Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched Ronan impatiently.
----------------------------------------------
“Unusually bright.” “Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
At last, Ronan said, “The forest hides many secrets.” A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagridraise Hagrid bow again, but Hagrid was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“All right?” “Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?” “Well enough.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily.
----------------------------------------------
“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a centaur.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was very glad the unicorns had Hagrid and Harry crossbow with the unicorns.
----------------------------------------------
the unicorns had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid!
----------------------------------------------
Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted.
----------------------------------------------
At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was fuming.
----------------------------------------------
I’m sorry,Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but Harry’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.
----------------------------------------------
“You had better get back to Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Over the rustling of the trees, Harry seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told Harry on the night they had met: “Some say Harry died.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, are you all right?” Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, The unicorn’s dead’s in that clearing back there.” “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was the only one who ever sent Harry letters.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy .
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.
----------------------------------------------
Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think?
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside Hagrid house; Hagrid trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and Hagrid was shelling peas into a large bowl.
----------------------------------------------
“Hullo,” Hagrid said, smiling.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something.
----------------------------------------------
What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” “Dunno said Hagrid casually, “Hagrid wouldn’ take Hagrid cloak off.” Hagrid saw the three of them look stunned and raised Hagrid eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
“What did you talk to Harry about, Hagrid?
----------------------------------------------
Did you mention Hogwarts at all?” Mighta bin a dragon dealer come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as Hagrid tried to remember.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid asked what I did, an’ I told Hagrid I was gamekeeper here.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after ...
----------------------------------------------
so I told Hagrid ...
----------------------------------------------
So I told it ter, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm yeh down, jus’ play yeh a bit o’ music an’ yeh’ll go straight off ter sleep — ” Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given Harry for Christmas.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pocketed the flute Hagrid to use on Fluffy — Harry didn’t feel much like singing.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, here goes ...” Snape put Hagrid’s flute to Snape lips and blew.
----------------------------------------------
“Who is it?” Hagrid sidled through the door as Dumbledore spoke.
----------------------------------------------
As usual when Dumbledore was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into Yeh beard.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, this is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, Yeh’d have found out even if you hadn’t told Yeh.” “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ don’ say the name!” “VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, Harry stopped crying.
----------------------------------------------
Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, itHarry’s gone, Harry can’t use it.
----------------------------------------------
...” Hagrid wiped Hagrid nose on the back of Hagrid hand and said, “That reminds me.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got Yeh a present.” “It’s not a stoat sandwich, is It?” said Harryanxiously, and at Hagrid Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.
----------------------------------------------
d’yeh like it?” Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.

“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.

Aunt Petunia
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter Aunt Petunia was awake and His Aunt Petunia was His Aunt Petunia shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia rapped on the door again.
----------------------------------------------
“Up!” His Aunt Petunia screeched.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heard His Aunt Petunia walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia was back outside the door .
----------------------------------------------
“Are you up yet?” His Aunt Petunia demanded.
----------------------------------------------
“What did you say?” His Aunt Petunia snapped through the door .
----------------------------------------------
Harry had had it as long as Harry could remember, and the first question Harry could ever remember asking His Aunt Petunia was how Harry had gotten it.
----------------------------------------------
“In the car crash when your parents died,” His Aunt Petunia had said.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because His Aunt Petunia said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today.
----------------------------------------------
thirty ...” “Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
At that moment the telephone rang and His Aunt Petuniawent to answer the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley’s unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.
----------------------------------------------
Atta boy, Dudley!” was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when His Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
----------------------------------------------
“Bad news, Uncle Vernon,” His Aunt Petunia said.
----------------------------------------------
“Now what?” said His Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry Harry as though Harry’d planned this.
----------------------------------------------
“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?” “On vacation in Majorca,” snapped His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia looked as though His Aunt Petunia’d just swallowed a lemon.
----------------------------------------------
“And come back and find The whole house smelled of cabbage in ruins?” His Aunt Petunia snarled.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose we could take Harry to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, "...
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s always sp- spoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with Dudley’s .
----------------------------------------------
Once, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair so short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had laughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was already laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Next morning, however, Dudley’s had gotten up to find his hair exactly as his hair had been before His Aunt Petunia had sheared his hair off.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia had been given a week in His Aunt Petunia cupboard for this, even though His Aunt Petunia had tried to explain that His Aunt Petunia couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly.
----------------------------------------------
Another time, His Aunt Petunia had been trying to force His Aunt Petunia into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls).
----------------------------------------------
The harder His Aunt Petunia tried to pull The over His Aunt Petunia head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to His Aunt Petunia great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.
----------------------------------------------
While Dudley’s drove, Uncle Vernon complained to His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was His Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least Harry got to visit the rest of the house.
----------------------------------------------
“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” " The zoo director himself made His Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while The zoo director himself apologized over and over again.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before Uncle Vernon collapsed into a chair, and His Aunt Petunia had to run and get Uncle Vernon a large brandy.
----------------------------------------------
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to A tiny man in a violet top hat once while out shopping with His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
After asking Harry furiously if Harry knew A tiny man in a violet top hat, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.
----------------------------------------------
One day in July, His Aunt Petunia took Dudley’s to London to buy His Aunt Petunia Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said His Aunt Petunia couldn’t believe it was His Aunt Petunia Ickle Dudleykins, His Aunt Petunia looked so handsome and grown-up.
----------------------------------------------
asked His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia lips tightened as they always did if the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Your new school uniform,” His Aunt Petunia said.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh,” Harry said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” “Don’t be stupid,” snapped His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
“Mrs. Figg’s,” Uncle Vernon informed His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
For a moment it looked as though His Aunt Petunia might faint.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia clutched His Aunt Petunia throat and made a choking noise.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon,” His Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where Harry sleeps?
----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia heard Dudley’s banging things with Dudley’s Smelting stick all the way down the hall.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake His Aunt Petunia had just brought -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Twenty-four letters to Harry found Twenty-four letters to Harry way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that Twenty-four letters to Harry very confused milkman had handed His Aunt Petunia through the living room window.
----------------------------------------------
While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, His Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in His Aunt Petunia food processor.
----------------------------------------------
When His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and Dudley arms over Aunt Petunia and Dudley faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
----------------------------------------------
Aunt Petunia and Dudley could hear Twenty-four letters to Harry still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going.
----------------------------------------------
•k k k “Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” His Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear The woman.
----------------------------------------------
“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t Uncle Vernon?” Dudley’s asked His Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer His Aunt Petunia when His Aunt Petunia asked what Uncle Vernon’d bought.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley’s on the moth-eaten sofa.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor Harry could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
----------------------------------------------
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.
----------------------------------------------
“You knew I’m a — a wizard?” “Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
He’d spent Him life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if Him was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock Him in Him cupboard?
----------------------------------------------
Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, Uncle Vernon cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind Aunt Petunia and Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harrythought, Harry heart sinking.
----------------------------------------------
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry to do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t speak to Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice.
----------------------------------------------
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
----------------------------------------------
Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let a pointed wizard’s hat in the house.
----------------------------------------------
From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Uncle Vernon
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.
----------------------------------------------
“Comb your hair!” Uncle Vernon barked, by way of a morning greeting.
----------------------------------------------
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of Uncle Vernon newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.
----------------------------------------------
“All right then.” Uncle Vernon chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
At that moment the telephone rang and His Aunt Petuniawent to answer the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley’s unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.
----------------------------------------------
“Bad news, Uncle Vernon,” His Aunt Petunia said.
----------------------------------------------
“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t be silly, Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon hates a large blond boy.” the Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though Harry wasn’t there — or rather, as though Harry was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with Dudley’s, but before His aunt and uncle’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you,” Uncle Vernon had said, putting Uncle Vernon large purple face right up close to his money’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
But all he’d tried to do (as all he’d shouted at Uncle Vernon Uncle Vernon through the locked door of Uncle Vernon cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.
----------------------------------------------
While Dudley’s drove, Uncle Vernon complained to His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harrywere just a few of Uncle Vernon favorite subjects.
----------------------------------------------
“It was flying.” Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
----------------------------------------------
the animals ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley’s had a tantrum because Dudley’s knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought Dudley’s another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place could have wrapped the largest snake in the place body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed its body into a trash can — but at the moment its body didn’t look in the mood.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with Uncle Vernon knuckles, but the largest snake in the placejust snoozed on.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its beady eyes to the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
As far as Harry had seen, the largest snake in the place hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at Piers and Dudley heels as the largest snake in the place passed, but by the time Piers and Dudley were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley’s was telling Piers and Dudley how the largest snake in the place had nearly bitten off Dudley’s leg, while Piers was swearing the largest snake in the place had tried to squeeze Dudley’s to death.
----------------------------------------------
But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harrywas talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was so angry Uncle Vernon could hardly speak.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before Uncle Vernon collapsed into a chair, and His Aunt Petunia had to run and get Uncle Vernon a large brandy.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s had been accepted at Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings.
----------------------------------------------
As he looked at Dudley’s in he new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of he life.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Mrs. Figg’s new uniform.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon opened Uncle Vernon newspaper as usual and Dudley’s banged Uncle Vernon Smelting stick, which Uncle Vernon carried everywhere, on the table.
----------------------------------------------
“Get the mail, Dudley’s,” said Uncle Vernon from behind Uncle Vernon paper.
----------------------------------------------
Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen.
----------------------------------------------
Harry handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open The envelope.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.
----------------------------------------------
“Mrs. Figg’s,” Uncle Vernon informed His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
“Dad, Mrs. Figg’s got something!” Harry was on the point of unfolding Harry letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of Harry hand by Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of Uncle Vernon reach.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to read a letter,” said Harry furiously, “as a letter’s mine.” “Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside a letter envelope.
----------------------------------------------
“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and Uncle Vernon took both Harryand Dudley’s by the scruffs of both necks and threw both into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind both.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon,” His Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where Harry sleeps?
----------------------------------------------
You don’t think they’re watching the house?” “Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.
----------------------------------------------
“But what should us do, Uncle Vernon?
----------------------------------------------
Tell they us don’t want — ” Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.
----------------------------------------------
Didn’t us swear when us took — ” in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?” That evening when — ” got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something — ” ’d never done before; ’dvisited Harry in — ” cupboard.
----------------------------------------------
“Where’s a letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door.
----------------------------------------------
No one was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly.
----------------------------------------------
“I have burned No one.” “It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “It had my cupboard on It.” “SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
----------------------------------------------
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley’s go and get it.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia heard Dudley’s banging things with Dudley’s Smelting stick all the way down the hall.
----------------------------------------------
Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, Privet Drive — ’ ” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in Harry hand.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what Harry’d been trying to do.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told Harry to go and make a cup of tea.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time Harry got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap.
----------------------------------------------
“I want — ” Harry began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing three letters before Uncle Vernon eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again.
----------------------------------------------
After burning all the letters, Uncle Vernon got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as Uncle Vernon worked, and jumped at small noises.
----------------------------------------------
While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, His Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in His Aunt Petunia food processor.
----------------------------------------------
•k k k On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.
----------------------------------------------
“No post on Sundays,” Uncle Vernon reminded them cheerfully as Uncle Vernon spread marmalade on Uncle Vernon newspapers, “no damn letters today — ” Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as Something spoke and caught Something sharply on the back of the head.
----------------------------------------------
OUT!Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw Harry into the hall.
----------------------------------------------
When His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and Dudley arms over Aunt Petunia and Dudley faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
----------------------------------------------
“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of Uncle Vernon mustache at the same time.
----------------------------------------------
No arguments!” Uncle Vernon looked so dangerous with half Uncle Vernon mustache missing that no one dared argue.
----------------------------------------------
Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city.
----------------------------------------------
Potter Room Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for a letter but Uncle Vernonknocked Uncle Vernon hand out of the way.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following The woman from the dining room.
----------------------------------------------
•k k k “Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” His Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear The woman.
----------------------------------------------
Exactly what Uncle Vernon was looking for, none of them knew.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook Uncle Vernon head, got back in the car, and off them went again.
----------------------------------------------
“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t Uncle Vernon?” Dudley’s asked His Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s Monday,” Uncle Vernon told Uncle Vernon mother.
----------------------------------------------
Of course, Uncle Vernon birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given Uncle Vernon a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old socks.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was back and Uncle Vernon was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer His Aunt Petunia when His Aunt Petunia asked what Uncle Vernon’d bought.
----------------------------------------------
“Found the perfect place!” Uncle Vernon said.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.
----------------------------------------------
“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernongleefully, clapping Uncle Vernon hands together.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!” It was freezing in his boat.
----------------------------------------------
After what seemed like hours their reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.
----------------------------------------------
There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon’s rations tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.
----------------------------------------------
“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” Uncle Vernon’s rations said cheerfully.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon’s rations was in a very good mood.
----------------------------------------------
Obviously Uncle Vernon’s rations thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor Harry could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was holding a rifle in Uncle Vernon hands — now they knew what had been in the long, thin package Uncle Vernon had brought with they.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’s there?” Uncle Vernon shouted.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s squeaked and ran to hide behind Dudley’s mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
----------------------------------------------
“You are breaking and entering!” “Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said A giant of a man; A giant of a man reached over the back of the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent the gun into a knot as easily as if the gun had been made of rubber, and threw the gun into a corner of the second room.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything Dudley’s gives you, Dudley’s.” A giant of a man chuckled darkly.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagridstared wildly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon suddenly found Yeh voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Stop!” Uncle Vernon commanded.
----------------------------------------------
I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.
----------------------------------------------
“Where was I?” said Hagrid Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
----------------------------------------------
An’ An’’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” “we swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him!
----------------------------------------------
Brought yeh ter this lot ...” “Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back Harry courage.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was glaring at Hagrid and Uncle Vernon fists were clenched.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, you listen here, boy,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, your parents were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without your parents in my opinion — asked for all your parents got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew your parents’d come to a sticky end — ” But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside Hagrid coat.
----------------------------------------------
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, Uncle Vernon said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word ...” In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; Uncle Vernon’s flattened Uncle Vernon’s against the wall and fell silent.
----------------------------------------------
He’d spent Him life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if Him was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock Him in Him cupboard?
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.
----------------------------------------------
“Haven’t I told you Uncle Vernon’s not going?” Uncle Vernon hissed.
----------------------------------------------
“Uncle Vernon’s going to Stonewall High and Uncle Vernon’ll be grateful for it.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve read those letters and Uncle Vernon needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and — ” “If Uncle Vernon wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop Uncle Vernon,” growled Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hogwarts’ll be with youngsters of Hogwarts own sort, fer a change, an’ Hogwarts’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled — ” “I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon roared.
----------------------------------------------
Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, Uncle Vernon cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind Aunt Petunia and Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ...
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.
----------------------------------------------
The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.
----------------------------------------------
Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got ter .” They settled down in The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine Harry flying.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid pulled out his umbrella again, tapped Hagrid twice on the side of The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, and they sped off toward land.
----------------------------------------------
Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read Harry newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while people did this, but it was very difficult, Harry’d never had so many questions in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic solutions to Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” At this moment The boat Uncle Vernon had hired bumped gently into the harbor wall.
----------------------------------------------
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry to do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t speak to Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — Uncle Vernon?” Uncle Vernon grunted to show ” Uncle Vernon was listening.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — Uncle Vernon — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — ” to go to Hogwarts.” Uncle Vernon grunted again.
----------------------------------------------
“Thank you.” Harry was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.
----------------------------------------------
“Platform what?” “Nine and three-quarters.” “Don’t talk rubbish,” said ” Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“There is no platform nine and three-quarters.” “It’s on my ticket.” “Barking,” said ” Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them.
----------------------------------------------
“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled ” Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled Harry’s trunk into the station for Harry’s.
----------------------------------------------
Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon left without another word.
----------------------------------------------
From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.
----------------------------------------------
“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“See you over the summer, then.” “Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
“Now what?” said His Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry Harry as though Harry’d planned this.
----------------------------------------------
The weirdest thing about all these people was the way all these people seemed to vanish Harry Harry tried to get a closer look.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.” Harry Harry woke early the next morning.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was so huge that Hagrid parted the crowd easily; Harry Harry had to do was keep close behind Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
what an honor.” Harry hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry Harry and seized Harry hand, tears in Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
----------------------------------------------
They fell backward Harry Harry slammed the door shut, and They ran, They almost flew, back down a corridor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Harry had difficulty hiding Harry glee as Harry handed the note to Ron to read.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s a broomstick,” That’s a broomstick said, throwing the package from Harry back to Harry Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Neville said to Harry Harry as Harry pushed Harry way into the crowded corridor, “Harry’s a nightmare, honestly.” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past Harry.
----------------------------------------------
But the news that Harry was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harrydidn’t know which was worse — people telling Harry Harry’d be brilliant or people telling Harry — people’d be running around underneath Harry holding a mattress.
----------------------------------------------
Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath.
----------------------------------------------
Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing we, Harry Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses askew.
----------------------------------------------
And slowly, Harrylooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like Harry, other noses like Harry, even a little old man who looked as though Harry had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry Harry was looking at Harry family, for the first time in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
“Well done,” said Dumbledore gently quietly, so that Harry Harry could hear.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they’d lost.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry looked up at Harry Harry and said, “If anything happens to Harry, don’t follow.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah,” said Harry, “and Harry Harry doesn’t lose Harry head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
----------------------------------------------
“I might get lucky again.” Hermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Next to Severus, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?Harry Harry couldn’t take it in.
----------------------------------------------
““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, bewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Wood
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone.
----------------------------------------------
Beech-wood and dragon heartstring.
----------------------------------------------
“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?Wood ?
----------------------------------------------
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane Professor McGonagall was going to use on Harry?
----------------------------------------------
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Professor Flitwick’s class looking confused.
----------------------------------------------
“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, this is Wood .
----------------------------------------------
Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.” Wood ’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood .
----------------------------------------------
Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.” Wood was now looking as though all Charlie Weasley dreams had come true at once.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall explained.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie Weasley’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, Ron just sat and gaped at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep Wood a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when Wood told Fred and George Weasley.” “Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood reckons Wood The boy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in we first week.
----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.
----------------------------------------------
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harrymounted his new broomstick and kicked off from the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood was carrying a large wooden crate under Oliver Wood arm.
----------------------------------------------
Harry landed next to Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“Very nice,” said Wood, Oliver Wood eyes glinting.
----------------------------------------------
“Right,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
Three of them are called Chasers.” “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Oliver Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.
----------------------------------------------
“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?” “What’s basketball?” said Oliver Wood curiously.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll show you now,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry swung at Harry’s face with the bat to stop Harry’s face from breaking Harry nose, and sent Harry’s face zigzagging away into the air — Harry’s face zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of Harry’s face and managed to pin Harry’s face to the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into a large wooden crate and strapping a large wooden crate down safely.
----------------------------------------------
“Very good,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or The Bludgers — ” “ — unless they crack my head open.” “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of the Bludgers.” Oliver Wood reached into a large wooden crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
----------------------------------------------
“This,” said Oliver Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and This’s the most important ball of the lot.
----------------------------------------------
“We won’t practice with the Golden Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting Wood back inside a large wooden crate, “Wood’s too dark, we might lose Wood.
----------------------------------------------
Let’s try you out with a few of these.” Harry pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of Harry pocket and a few minutes later, Harry and Harry were up in the air, Oliver Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as Harry could in every direction for Harry to catch.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Oliver Wood was delighted.
----------------------------------------------
“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Oliver Wood happily as Oliver Wood trudged back up to the castle.
----------------------------------------------
the troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up even a troll nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in Harry hand when Harry’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.
----------------------------------------------
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as anyone secret weapon, Harryshould be kept, well, secret.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all Harry homework without Harry now had Hermione as a friend, what with all the last- minute Quidditch practice Wood was making Quidditch practice Wood do.
----------------------------------------------
Wood cleared Wood throat for silence.
----------------------------------------------
“Okay, men,” Wood said.
----------------------------------------------
“And women,” Wood agreed.
----------------------------------------------
“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “We were on the team last year.” “Shut up, you two,” said Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
This was part of Harry and Wood’s game plan.
----------------------------------------------
“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch ,” Wood had said.
----------------------------------------------
Harrytried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — Harry had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then Harry realized that His broom was completely out of Harry control.
----------------------------------------------
Wood was working the team harder than ever.
----------------------------------------------
The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side.
----------------------------------------------
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s not my fault,” said Wood.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as Harry pulled on his robes and picked up Harry Nimbus Two Thousand.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t nag.” Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harryaside.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt so ashamed of Harry that Harry went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
----------------------------------------------
“Resign?” Wood thundered.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermionecried, wringing Hermione hands.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah,” said Harry, “and Harry Harry doesn’t lose Harry head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” Harry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
----------------------------------------------
An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” “Er — no,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I knew Yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud!
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.
----------------------------------------------
of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
----------------------------------------------
Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell Yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” ta threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.
----------------------------------------------
One o’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.
----------------------------------------------
“Stop Lily an’ James PotterHe’s son goin’ Hogwarts!
----------------------------------------------
Hogwarts name’s been down ever since Hogwarts was born.
----------------------------------------------
Hogwarts’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world.
----------------------------------------------
Seven years there and Hogwarts won’t know Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
Hogwarts’ll be with youngsters of Hogwarts own sort, fer a change, an’ Hogwarts’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled — ” “I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
But Hogwarts had finally gone too far.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------
“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” Hagrid said.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts Hogwarts but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything Hagrid want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew Hagrid up proudly.
----------------------------------------------
“If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic.
----------------------------------------------
“They wanted DUMBLEDORE fer Minister, o’ course, but Dumbledore fer ’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” Harry unfolded a second piece of paper Harry hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: .
----------------------------------------------
Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; waved and smiled at Hagrid, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?” “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping Hagrid great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
Hogwarts business.
----------------------------------------------
“Hogwarts, dear?” Madam Malkin’s said, when Harry started to speak.
----------------------------------------------
“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” “Yes,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid works at Hogwarts.” “Oh,” said a boy with a pale, “I’ve heard of a boy with a pale.
----------------------------------------------
Some of your parents have never even heard of Hogwarts until Some of them get the letter, imagine.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the boy.
----------------------------------------------
You-Know-Who was one.” “Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine.
----------------------------------------------
But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.” Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take Harry back to the Dursleys, then handed Harry an envelope.
----------------------------------------------
“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” Yer ticket fer Hogwarts said.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — Uncle Vernon — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — ” to go to Hogwarts.” Uncle Vernon grunted again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.
----------------------------------------------
a passing guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell Harry what part of the country it was in, Harry started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose.
----------------------------------------------
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, Harry had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and Harry had no idea how to do it; Harry was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk Harry could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
----------------------------------------------
“First time at Hogwarts?
----------------------------------------------
A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock.
----------------------------------------------
The youngest boy had already changed into The youngest boy billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on Harry chest with the letter P on it.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” “Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” “ Georg e\” “Only joking, a small girl.” the train began to move.
----------------------------------------------
“Anyone sitting there?” the youngest redheaded boy asked, pointing at a Hogwarts toilet seat.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
a girl was already wearing a girl new Hogwarts robes.
----------------------------------------------
A voice echoed through The train: “Ron, will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over Hagrid shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” There was a loud “Oooooh!” The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- breaking will lose House points.
----------------------------------------------
I read about It in Hogwarts, A History.” It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.
----------------------------------------------
You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap Your top hats.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” Professor Binns said.
----------------------------------------------
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around his.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
----------------------------------------------
“Never at Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
“I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and Charlie Weasley could have played for England if Charlie Weasley hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” Perhaps it was because Charlie Weasley was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all Charlie Weasley homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when Charlie Weasley realized that Charlie Weasley’d already been at Hogwarts two months.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, Snape’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did Snape just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
One morning in mid- December, Hogwarts woke to find Hogwarts covered in several feet of snow.
----------------------------------------------
“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.” He was looking over at Harry as He spoke.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy was insultin’ Malfoy family.” “Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said Snape silkily.
----------------------------------------------
These were bookscontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts , and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.
----------------------------------------------
The whole of Hogwarts was open to Harry in an Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with the wooden door windows glowing red in the setting sun.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry are if Harry want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely.
----------------------------------------------
I thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, my father’d — ” “ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagridgrowled.
----------------------------------------------
Did you mention Hogwarts at all?” Mighta bin a dragon dealer come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as Hagrid tried to remember.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts?
----------------------------------------------
There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from!
----------------------------------------------
Snape was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know?
----------------------------------------------
for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.
----------------------------------------------
This seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.

Sorcerer
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
If Him’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick Him around like a football?
----------------------------------------------
“Nicolas Flamel,” Hermione whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\” This didn’t have quite the effect Hermione’d expected.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
the Sorcerer’s Stone will transform any metal into pure gold.
----------------------------------------------
the Sorcerer’s Stone also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
----------------------------------------------
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover.
----------------------------------------------
“The dog must be guarding Flamel’s the Sorcerer’s Stone!
----------------------------------------------
I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep it safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew someone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is Ron?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d do with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one.
----------------------------------------------
Could Snapepossibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone?
----------------------------------------------
“Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” Harry leaned forward.
----------------------------------------------
“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help Snape’s get Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
Snapewas sweeping about in Snape usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Sorcerer’s Stone was still safe.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, however, had more on Hermione mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone.
----------------------------------------------
“And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a the Sorcerer’s Stone’s St — ” “Shhhh\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
----------------------------------------------
“Sorcerer’s St — come an’ see me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think it had anything to do with the Sorcerer’s Stone?” “I’m going to see what section Hagrid was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough of working.
----------------------------------------------
Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.” it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” always wanted a dragon, it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” told me so the first time I ever met a dragon,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“We were wondering if you could tell We what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy.” Hagrid frowned at Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
If Snape had been in on protecting the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape had been in on protecting the Stone must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded Snape had been in on protecting the Stone.
----------------------------------------------
All the same, Harry’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in Snape step Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?” “The Sorcerer’s Stone!
----------------------------------------------
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harryhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on they foreheads, but Harry and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about The Sorcerer’s Stone as HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------

*************************************************
Gringotts
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything Hagrid want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.
----------------------------------------------
And then yeh gotta find yer way Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see.
----------------------------------------------
Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, anyone but a Gringotts goblin’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook!” .
----------------------------------------------
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.
----------------------------------------------
I hate them Gringotts carts.” Harry did still look a bit sick, so Harryentered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Did you hear about Gringotts?
----------------------------------------------
The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts led to the upper floors.
----------------------------------------------
flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.
----------------------------------------------
flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts crowded in, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
standing rather closer together than flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts would usually have done, peering about nervously.
----------------------------------------------
It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet : GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken.
----------------------------------------------
“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.
----------------------------------------------
Harry remembered Ron telling Harry on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts , but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid !” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
----------------------------------------------
In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
----------------------------------------------
I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep it safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew someone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all?
----------------------------------------------
The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts.
----------------------------------------------
When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, Lord Voldemort was most displeased.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Quirrell
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
“N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” “Professor Quirrell laughed nervously.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- book on vampires, m-myself.” “Professor Quirrell looked terrified at the very thought.
----------------------------------------------
But the others wouldn’t let “Professor Quirrell keep Harry to “Professor Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind ’s usually tremblin’.” “Is Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind always that nervous?” “Oh, yeah.
----------------------------------------------
Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind was fine while Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind was studyin’ outta books but then Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.
----------------------------------------------
They say Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since.
----------------------------------------------
Scared of the students, scared of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?” Vampires?
----------------------------------------------
two across ...” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind muttered.
----------------------------------------------
“Right, stand back, Harry.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind tapped the wall above the trash can three times with the point of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind umbrella.
----------------------------------------------
The brick Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind had touched quivered — The brick he had touched wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — The brick he had touched grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind grinned at Harry’s amazement.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t stop stammering Harry thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
“All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Quirrell, in Professor Quirrell absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
----------------------------------------------
a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skinlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’s that teacher talking to Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you?
----------------------------------------------
No wonder Quirrell’s looking so nervous, he’s the Slytherin ghost.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell teaches Potions, but Quirrell doesn’t want to — everyone knows Quirrell’s he’s the Slytherin ghost .
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch wouldn’t believe Harry and Ron were lost, was sure Harry and Ron were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock Harry and Ron in the dungeons when Harry and Ron were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.
----------------------------------------------
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell’s classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get Quirrell’s one of these days.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell’s , Quirrell’s told them, had been given to Quirrell’s by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but them weren’t sure them believed this story.
----------------------------------------------
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, them had noticed that a funny smell hung around Quirrell’s turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that Quirrell was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever Quirrell went.
----------------------------------------------
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened Hermione mouth, perhaps to tell Ronexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harryhissed at Hermione to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the whole room , closely followed by Snape, with Professor Quirrell bringing up the rear.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Quirrell took one look at even a troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that the Weasley twins followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of Quirrell turban.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was there, too.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was mumbling something.
----------------------------------------------
“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet?” “B-b-but Severus, I — ” “You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking a step toward Snape.
----------------------------------------------
It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though Harry was petrified.
----------------------------------------------
“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help Snape’s get Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell, however, must have been braver than THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell’d thought.
----------------------------------------------
In the weeks that followed THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but ’d didn’t look as though THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell’d cracked yet.
----------------------------------------------
Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days Harry gave Harry an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore ticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course.
----------------------------------------------
Snape probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry drew closer, Harry heard Quirrell’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
“All right — all right — ” Harry heard Quirrell sob.
----------------------------------------------
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening Quirrell turban.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was pale and looked as though Quirrell was about to cry.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell strode out of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom straightening his turban.
----------------------------------------------
All the same, Harry’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in Snape step Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.
----------------------------------------------
“If Quirrell’s told Ron how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Quirrell’s too scared to back we up.
----------------------------------------------
“What do you reckonhe’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured The chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” them had reached another door.
----------------------------------------------
THE MAN WITH TWO FACES It was Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell smiled.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell face wasn’t twitching at all.
----------------------------------------------
“Me,” Quirrell said calmly.
----------------------------------------------
“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — Snape — ” “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and Quirrell wasn’t Quirrell usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
----------------------------------------------
Next to Severus, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?Harry Harry couldn’t take it in.
----------------------------------------------
I’d have managed that broom before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.” Snape Snape was trying to save me?” “Of course,” said Quirrell coolly.
----------------------------------------------
and what a waste of time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.” Quirrell snapped his fingers.
----------------------------------------------
I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
“the Mirror of Erised is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrellmurmured, tapping Quirrell way around the frame.
----------------------------------------------
but Quirrell’s in London ...
----------------------------------------------
I’ll be far away by the time Quirrell gets back.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrelltalking and stop Quirrell from concentrating on the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the Mirror of Erised to look at the back.
----------------------------------------------
...” Quirrell came back out from behind the Mirror of Erised and stared hungrily into the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had to keep Quirrell from giving Harry whole attention to the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” “Oh, Snape does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes.
----------------------------------------------
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
...” Quirrell’s voice trailed away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with Harry in the Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell cursed under Quirrell breath.
----------------------------------------------
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, Harry thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does.
----------------------------------------------
But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around Harry ankles were too tight: Harry tripped and fell over.
----------------------------------------------
Help me, “Master!” And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Use the boy ...” Quirrell rounded on Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Come here,” Quirrell repeated.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell moved close behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban.
----------------------------------------------
“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” Quirrell cursed again.
----------------------------------------------
But Dumbledore hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving Dumbledore lips.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore lies ...” Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted.
----------------------------------------------
Petrified, Devil’s Snare watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap Devil’s Snare turban.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without his turban.
----------------------------------------------
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
----------------------------------------------
you saw Quirrell Quirrell drinking Quirrell for me in the forest ...
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was walking backward at Harry, so that Voldemort could still see Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Now give me the Stone, unless you want your mother to have died in vain.” “NEVER!” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist.
----------------------------------------------
At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; Harry head felt as though it was about to split in two; Harry yelled, struggling with all Harry might, and to Harry surprise, Quirrell let go of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The pain in Harry head lessened — Harry looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw Harry hunched in pain, looking at Harry fingers — they were blistering before Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, bewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell raised Quirrell hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — “AAAARGH!” Quirrell rolled off Quirrell, Quirrell face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch Harry bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep his in enough pain to stop his from doing a curse.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only hear Harry’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
----------------------------------------------
Harry!” Harry felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from Harry grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ...
----------------------------------------------
It was Quirrell!
----------------------------------------------
“Quirrell does not have the Stone.” “Then who does?
----------------------------------------------
“What happened down in the dungeons between you and Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell did not manage to take it from you.
----------------------------------------------
I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you — ” “It was you.” “I feared I might be too late.” “You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept Quirrell off the Stone much longer — ” “Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s left Quirrell to die; Harry’s shows just as little mercy to Harry’s followers as Harry’s enemies.
----------------------------------------------
“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?” “my mother died to save you.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing Quirrell soul with Lord Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
----------------------------------------------

Quidditch
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Play Quidditch at all?” “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.
----------------------------------------------
When They had left the shop, Harry said, “Hagrid, whatStalagmite’s Quidditch?” “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little Harry know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!” “Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Look what she had fer a sister!” “So what is Quidditch?” “It’s our sport.
----------------------------------------------
It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” “School Houses.
----------------------------------------------
Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch.
----------------------------------------------
“WhatNow Percy’s a prefect your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.
----------------------------------------------
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.
----------------------------------------------
“Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good Malfoy is at Quidditch, but I bet thatSeamus’s all talk.” Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycomplained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with Malfoy narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.
----------------------------------------------
At breakfast on Thursday Harry bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages.
----------------------------------------------
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around his.
----------------------------------------------
“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Harry Potter?” Charlie Weasley asked excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“Your father was an excellent Quidditch player himself.” “You’re joking.” It was dinnertime.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.
----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.
----------------------------------------------
It kept wandering up to the dormitory where Harry new broomstick was lying under Harry bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where Harry’d be learning to play that night.
----------------------------------------------
As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field.
----------------------------------------------
Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the Quidditch field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.
----------------------------------------------
At either end of the Quidditch field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.
----------------------------------------------
What a feeling — Harry swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the Quidditch field.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play.
----------------------------------------------
A game of Quidditch only ends when the Golden Snitch is caught, so the Golden Snitch can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, the Golden Snitch had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.
----------------------------------------------
“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Oliver Wood happily as Oliver Wood trudged back up to the castle.
----------------------------------------------
“I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and Charlie Weasley could have played for England if Charlie Weasley hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” Perhaps it was because Charlie Weasley was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all Charlie Weasley homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when Charlie Weasley realized that Charlie Weasley’d already been at Hogwarts two months.
----------------------------------------------
QUIDDITCH As QUIDDITCH entered November, the weather turned very cold.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
----------------------------------------------
The QUIDDITCH season had begun.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all Harry homework without Harry now had Hermione as a friend, what with all the last- minute Quidditch practice Wood was making Quidditch practice Wood do.
----------------------------------------------
Harry now had Hermione as a friend had also lent Harry Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.
----------------------------------------------
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul had happened during a World Cup match in ; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
----------------------------------------------
The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and Hermione had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” Potter was Quidditch Through the Ages.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take Harry mind off Harry nerves about tomorrow.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry needed to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy to forget.
----------------------------------------------
The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch.
----------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into the team scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.
----------------------------------------------
“Filch’s George Weasley ever refereed a Quidditch match?
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve just got to make sure We play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on We.” Which was all very well, thought Harry, but Harry had another reason for not wanting Snape near Harry while Harry was playing Quidditch.
----------------------------------------------
You look terrible.” Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t until Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.” “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost their all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt so ashamed of Harry that Harry went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
----------------------------------------------
How are we going to get any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?” But Quidditch Quidditch had lost Quidditch fun.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the Quidditch team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if The rest of the team had to speak about Harry, The rest of the team called Harry “the Seeker.” Hermione and Neville were suffering, too.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook Harry awake.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as Your friend Miss Granger rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
----------------------------------------------
It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls ...
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Slytherin
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing Harry could say something a bit more interesting.
----------------------------------------------
It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” “School Houses.
----------------------------------------------
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if Mom and Dad put me in Slytherin.” “That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?” “Yeah,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“your Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where Their are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find those of wit and learning kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve Those cunning folk ends.
----------------------------------------------
“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all Harry’d heard about Slytherin, but Harry thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.
----------------------------------------------
When a pointed wizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still wearing a pointed wizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a pointed wizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when ” Malfoy name was called and got ” Malfoy wish at once: a pointed wizard’s hat had barely touched ” Malfoy when a pointed wizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join ” Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
So where shall I put you?” Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice.
----------------------------------------------
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no?
----------------------------------------------
Harry was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, Harry hardly noticed that Harry was getting the loudest cheer yet.
----------------------------------------------
“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).
----------------------------------------------
No wonder Quirrell’s looking so nervous, he’s the Slytherin ghost.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell teaches Potions, but Quirrell doesn’t want to — everyone knows Quirrell’s he’s the Slytherin ghost .
----------------------------------------------
“Ithe’s the Slytherin ghostodd, because he’s the Slytherin ghost usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — he’s the Slytherin ghost, everyone knows that.
----------------------------------------------
I do think he’s the Slytherin ghost might have told us prefects, at least.” “And now, before us go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie’s eagle owl was always bringing Malfoy ’s eagle owl packages of sweets from home, which Harry opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl.
----------------------------------------------
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
On Saturday, Harrywould be playing in Harry first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into the team scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed that Madam Hooch seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch ?” A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over Adrian Pucey shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed Adrian Pucey left ear.
----------------------------------------------
Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs, too.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Higgs — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” the Slytherins were cheering.
----------------------------------------------
If they won they next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years.
----------------------------------------------
George WeasleyFilch’s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.” The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
----------------------------------------------
In stinking Slytherin.” Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as Slytherin unwrapped the frog.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says Snape’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!
----------------------------------------------
“And twenty points from Slytherin!
----------------------------------------------
Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on Harry, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup.
----------------------------------------------
The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
----------------------------------------------
the Great Hall was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Madam Pomfrey’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.
----------------------------------------------
A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging Harry goblet on the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little change of decoration.” He clapped He .
----------------------------------------------
In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took the huge Slytherin serpent place.
----------------------------------------------

Mr. Ollivander

----------------------------------------------
her first wand.” Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wished Mr. Ollivander would blink.
----------------------------------------------
Well, I say Your fatherfavored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.” Mr. Ollivander had come so close that the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“And that’s where ...” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” Mr. Ollivander said softly.
----------------------------------------------
But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
----------------------------------------------
“But you don’t use the pieces?” said Mr. Ollivander.
----------------------------------------------
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
----------------------------------------------
“That will do,” Mr. Ollivander said, and a long tape measurecrumpled into a heap on the floor.
----------------------------------------------
Just take it and give it a wave.” Harry took wand and (feeling foolish) waved wand around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched wand out of Mr. Ollivander hand almost at once.
----------------------------------------------
Try — ” Harry tried — but Harry had hardly raised wandwhen wand, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for.
----------------------------------------------
The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier Mr. Ollivander seemed to become.
----------------------------------------------
Hagridwhooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo!
----------------------------------------------
how very curious ...” Mr. Ollivander put Harry’s wand back into Harry’s box and wrapped its box in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious .
----------------------------------------------
curious “Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with Mr. Ollivander pale stare.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wasn’t sure Harry liked Mr. Ollivander too much.
----------------------------------------------
Harry paid seven gold Galleons for Harry wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed seven gold Galleons from Mr. Ollivander shop.
----------------------------------------------
“All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ...

*************************************************
Hedwig
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Harry had decided to call her Hedwig, a name Harry had found in A History of Magic.
----------------------------------------------
Harry lay on Harry bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as Hedwig pleased.
----------------------------------------------
It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig.
----------------------------------------------
Harry put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave Harry trunk toward the train door.
----------------------------------------------
Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far.
----------------------------------------------
Hedwig sometimes flew in to nibble Harry ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls.
----------------------------------------------
Send us an answer back with Hedwig.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
----------------------------------------------
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let It’s Hedwig in.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s Hedwig’ll have “Charlie’s answer!” The three of them put them heads together to read the note.
----------------------------------------------
Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------

*************************************************
Percy
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
All right, Percy, you go first.” What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.
----------------------------------------------
“Where’s Percy?” said Their mother.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to the prefects — ” “Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the red-haired twins , with an air of great surprise.
----------------------------------------------
“Once — ” “Or twice — ” “A minute — ” “All summer — ” “Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.
----------------------------------------------
“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the red-haired twins .
----------------------------------------------
“Because Percy’s a prefect,” said Their mother fondly.
----------------------------------------------
“All right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.” She kissed Percy on the cheek and Percy left.
----------------------------------------------
Now Percy’s a prefect.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Now Percy’s a prefect old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside Ron jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.
----------------------------------------------
Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink.
----------------------------------------------
Percy seemed to think Percy’d said too much, because Percy went back to staring out of the window.
----------------------------------------------
ThereNow Percy’s a prefect loads of people who come from Muggle families and There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families learn quick enough.” While There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families had been talking, the train had carried There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families out of London.
----------------------------------------------
What a smiling, dimpled woman did have were Now Percy’s a prefect Every Flavor Beans, Bertie Bott’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
“Unicorn hairNow Percy’s a prefect nearly poking out.
----------------------------------------------
Now Percy’s a prefect lost one,” a girl said.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve already told Now Percy’s a prefect We haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but a girl wasn’t listening, a girl was looking at a very battered-looking wand in Now Percy’s a prefect hand.
----------------------------------------------
LetNow Percy’s a prefect see it, then.” a girl sat down.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and itNow Percy’s a prefect worked for me.
----------------------------------------------
Nobody in my familyNow Percy’s a prefect magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, my letter’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I“ Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” Hermione Granger said all this very fast.
----------------------------------------------
Anyway, we’d better go and look for Now Percy’s a prefect toad.
----------------------------------------------
ItNow Percy’s a prefect been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.” Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
“WhatNow Percy’s a prefect your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.
----------------------------------------------
“I think RonNow Percy’s a prefect been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“No — I don’t believe it — Now Percy’s a prefect gone back to sleep.” And so Ron had.
----------------------------------------------
Percy the Prefect got up and shook Harry hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Harry Potter!
----------------------------------------------
“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
“Is Harry — a bit mad?” Harry asked Percy uncertainly.
----------------------------------------------
“Mad?” said Percy airily.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).
----------------------------------------------
“What is it?” asked Percy.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’s that teacher talking to Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
----------------------------------------------
muttered to Percy.
----------------------------------------------
“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Off you trot!” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because Percy was so tired and full of food.
----------------------------------------------
Percy was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as the people in the portraits along the corridors passed, or that Percy Percy led the people in the portraits along the corridors through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries.
----------------------------------------------
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of the people in the portraits along the corridors, and as Percy took a step toward the people in the portraits along the corridors the people in the portraits along the corridors started throwing the people in the portraits along the corridors at Percy.
----------------------------------------------
“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years.
----------------------------------------------
“A poltergeist.” Percy raised Percy voice, “Peeves — show yourself.” A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
----------------------------------------------
“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean this!” barked Percy.
----------------------------------------------
“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again.
----------------------------------------------
“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and a portrait of a very fat woman swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.
----------------------------------------------
Percy directed the girls through one door to the girls dormitory and the boys through another.
----------------------------------------------
“Go back to bed!” “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — your brother’s a prefect, your brother’d put a stop to this.” Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
----------------------------------------------
“Prefects,” “Prefects rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!” Percy was in Percy element.
----------------------------------------------
“But Percy’d better not see us.” Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy!” hissed Neville , pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
----------------------------------------------
Peering around a large stone griffin, however, “Percy!” saw not Percy but Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Percy crossed a deserted side corridor and disappeared from view.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s Percy doing?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Why isn’t Percy down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” “Search me.” Quietly as possible, Quietly crept along the next corridor after Snape ’s fading footsteps.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Neville held up Percy hand.
----------------------------------------------
Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing we, Harry Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses askew.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas is a time for family.” They frog-marched Percy from the room, They frog-marched Percy from the room arms pinned to They frog-marched Percy from the room side by They frog-marched Percy from the room .
----------------------------------------------
Percy nearly broke Percy teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in Percy slice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry suspected Harry wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help Harry so much.
----------------------------------------------
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower ’d stolen his prefect badge.
----------------------------------------------
Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you know!
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t you tell I’m George?” “Sorry, I’m George, dear.” “Only joking, I am Fred,” said the oldest boy, and off the oldest boy went.
----------------------------------------------
“Oy, Fred!
----------------------------------------------
“Fred?
----------------------------------------------
Is black-haired boy who was near us in really, Fred?
----------------------------------------------
“I forbid you to ask he, Fred.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and Lee Jordan’s jokes,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and I’m George mess around a lot, but Fred and George still get really good marks and everyone thinks Fred and George’re really funny.
----------------------------------------------
Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think Fred was joking.” Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt.
----------------------------------------------
But Fred didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would Fred have to do?
----------------------------------------------
Fred hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived.
----------------------------------------------
Fred looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll kill Fred, Fred was going on about wrestling a troll.” Harry smiled weakly.
----------------------------------------------
Yes, trying on a pointed wizard’s hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but Fred did wish they could have tried a pointed wizard’s hat on without everyone watching.
----------------------------------------------
“Cheer up,” said Ron, Seamus’s always taking points off Fred and George.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of Fred and George Weasley started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep Wood a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.
----------------------------------------------
“Fred and George Weasley haven’t won since Charlie Weasley left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant.
----------------------------------------------
You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when Wood told Fred and George Weasley.” “Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood reckons Wood The boy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in we first week.
----------------------------------------------
See you.” Fred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“This is it.” “The big one,” said Fred Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “We were on the team last year.” “Shut up, you two,” said Wood.
----------------------------------------------
Good luck, all of you.” Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping Harry knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
Once Harry caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting Harry way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas!” “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred and Georgeholding up Harry’s sweater.
----------------------------------------------
Weasley had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping Weasley presents as Weasley, too, carried a lumpy sweater over Weasley arm, which Fred seized.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and a wizard cracker didn’t just bang, a wizard cracker went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice.
----------------------------------------------
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower ’d stolen his prefect badge.
----------------------------------------------
Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.” “The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door.
----------------------------------------------
Fred was right.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.” “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time Fred and George ’ve been here, and people still like Fred and George .” “Fred and George ’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have Fred and George ?” said Harry miserably.
----------------------------------------------
I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.
----------------------------------------------
No doubt your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley thought it would amuse you.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
----------------------------------------------
I can see “Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” Fred Weasley smiled down at them.
----------------------------------------------
“You must be Harry’s family!” said Fred Weasley.
----------------------------------------------

Can’t you tell I’m George?” “Sorry, I’m George, dear.” “Only joking, I am Fred,” said the oldest boy, and off the oldest boy went.

I’m George?
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and I’m George mess around a lot, but Fred and George still get really good marks and everyone thinks Fred and George’re really funny.
----------------------------------------------
George reckons George had a booger-flavored one once.” Ron picked up a green bean, looked at a green bean carefully, and bit into a corner.
----------------------------------------------
“Stupid spell — George gave it to George , bet George knew it was a dud.” “what House what House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Cheer up,” said Ron, Seamus’s always taking points off Fred and George.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of Fred and George Weasley started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep Wood a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
----------------------------------------------
“Well done,” said George in a low voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told Fred and George Weasley.

Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.

Before Harry could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas!” “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.” “Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded.
----------------------------------------------
“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed.
----------------------------------------------
“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said George .
----------------------------------------------
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower ’d stolen his prefect badge.
----------------------------------------------
Filch’s refereeing this time, and Filch’s’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” George Weasley really did fall off George Weasley broom at these words.
----------------------------------------------
“Filch’s George Weasley ever refereed a Quidditch match?
----------------------------------------------
George WeasleyFilch’s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.” The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.

*************************************************
Ron
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Ron’s new, too.” the plump woman pointed at the last and youngest of the plump woman sons.
----------------------------------------------
Ron’s was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
----------------------------------------------
Go on, go now before Ron.” “Er — okay,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Ron pushed Ron trolley around and stared at the barrier.
----------------------------------------------
Ron started to walk toward It.
----------------------------------------------
People jostled Ron on People way to platforms nine and ten.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was going to smash right into the barrier and then Harry’d be in trouble — leaning forward on Harry cart, Ron broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — Harry wouldn’t be able to stop — his cart was out of control — Ron was a foot away — Ron closed Ron eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come ...
----------------------------------------------
Ron kept on running ...
----------------------------------------------
Ron opened his eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but The youngest boy grabbed The youngest boy and began rubbing the end of The youngest boy nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Shut up,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
And look after Ron.” “Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with We.” “Shut up,” said Ron again.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was almost as tall as the red-haired twins already and Ron nose was still pink where Their mother had rubbed his nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Ron.” The twins were back.
----------------------------------------------
“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” “Right,” mumbled Ron.
----------------------------------------------
And this is Ron, we brother.
----------------------------------------------
See you later, then.” “Bye,” said Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and Lee Jordan’s jokes,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“And have you really got — you know ...” Ron pointed at Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Ron stared.
----------------------------------------------
“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.” “Wow,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though Ron had suddenly realized what Ron was doing, Ron looked quickly out of the window again.
----------------------------------------------
“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.” “Five,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
For some reason, Ron was looking gloomy.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Now Percy’s a prefect old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside Ron jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron name’s Scabbers and Ron’s useless, Ron hardly ever wakes up.
----------------------------------------------
Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink.
----------------------------------------------
After all, Harry’d never had any money in Harry life until a month ago, and Harry told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
----------------------------------------------
This seemed to cheer Ron up.
----------------------------------------------
and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort — ” Ron gasped.
----------------------------------------------
“ You said You-Know-Who’s name\” said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed.
----------------------------------------------
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to Harry feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and Ron muttered that Ron’d brought sandwiches.
----------------------------------------------
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped the compartment onto an empty seat.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and a lumpy packagea lumpy package.
----------------------------------------------
Ron pulled one of four sandwiches apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t like corned beef.” “Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty.
----------------------------------------------
“Go on — ” “You don’t want this, this’s all dry,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“She hasn’t got much time,” Ron added quickly, “you know, with five of us.” “Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with.
----------------------------------------------
it was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
----------------------------------------------
“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
----------------------------------------------
“No,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Albus Dumbledore!” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledoregone!” “Well, you can’t expect Albus Dumbledore to hang around all day,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
You can start collecting.” Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.
----------------------------------------------
What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed.
----------------------------------------------
Ronwas more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harrycouldn’t keep Ron’s eyes off the Famous Witches.
----------------------------------------------
Ron finally tore Ron’s eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.
----------------------------------------------
“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry.
----------------------------------------------
George reckons George had a booger-flavored one once.” Ron picked up a green bean, looked at a green bean carefully, and bit into a corner.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t know why ’s so bothered,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.” The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.
----------------------------------------------
“ might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said Ron in disgust.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve already told Now Percy’s a prefect We haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but a girl wasn’t listening, a girl was looking at a very battered-looking wand in Now Percy’s a prefect hand.
----------------------------------------------
Ron looked taken aback.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — all right.” Ron cleared Ron throat.
----------------------------------------------
“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” Ron waved a very battered-looking wand, but nothing happened.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by Harry stunned face that Harry hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.
----------------------------------------------
“Whatever what House I’m in, I hope she’s not in what House,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron threw a very battered-looking wand back into his trunk.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Gloom seemed to be settling on Ron again.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if Mom and Dad put me in Slytherin.” “That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?” “Yeah,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron flopped back into Ron seat, looking depressed.
----------------------------------------------
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off Houses.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“WhatNow Percy’s a prefect your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.
----------------------------------------------
“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, you wait, it“Charlie’s in Romaniathe best game in the world — ” And Ron was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games Ron’d been to with Ron brothers and the broomstick Ron’d like to get if Ron had the money.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was just taking Harrythrough the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but the compartment door wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.
----------------------------------------------
“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.
----------------------------------------------
Draco Malfoy looked at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” Both Harry and Ron stood up.
----------------------------------------------
“Say that again,” Ron said, Ron face as red as Ron hair.
----------------------------------------------
“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than Harry felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than Harry or Ron.
----------------------------------------------
us’ve eaten all us food and you still seem to have some.” Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron leapt forward, but before Ron’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.
----------------------------------------------
“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbersby Ron tail.
----------------------------------------------
“I think RonNow Percy’s a prefect been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Ron looked closer at Scabbers.
----------------------------------------------
“No — I don’t believe it — Now Percy’s a prefect gone back to sleep.” And so Ron had.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve heard of Harry family,” said Ron darkly.
----------------------------------------------
You’ll be in trouble before — Crabbe and Malfoy even get there!” Scabbers has been fighting, not — Crabbe and Malfoy,” said Ron, scowling at her.
----------------------------------------------
“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?” Ron glared at her as her left.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, took off Ron, jackets and pulled on Ron, .
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie’s in Romania were a bit short for Ron, you could see Ron sneakers underneath Ron, .
----------------------------------------------
A voice echoed through The train: “Ron, will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
Please leave your luggage on The train, The train will be taken to the school separately.” Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, Ron saw, looked pale under Ron freckles.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were followed into Harry and Ron boat by Neville and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“How exactly do they sort we into Houses?” he asked Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
“So we’ve just got to try on a pointed wizard’s hat!” Ron whispered to HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
Ron groaned.
----------------------------------------------
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
“Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was pale green by now.
----------------------------------------------
Harry crossed Harry fingers under the table and a second later a pointed wizard’s hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into a large gold chair next to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” “I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
----------------------------------------------
Ron’s chewing my sheets.” Harry was going to ask Ron if Ron’d had any of the treacle tart, but Harry fell asleep almost at once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of Harry on Harry and Ron very first morning.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch found Harry and Ron trying to force Harry and Ron way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch wouldn’t believe Harry and Ron were lost, was sure Harry and Ron were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock Harry and Ron in the dungeons when Harry and Ron were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.
----------------------------------------------
There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.
----------------------------------------------
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron finally managed to find Harry and Ron way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
----------------------------------------------
“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as Ron poured sugar on Ron porridge.
----------------------------------------------
“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
Harryglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as Harry was; Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
“Cheer up,” said Ron, Seamus’s always taking points off Fred and George.
----------------------------------------------
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking Ron ears.
----------------------------------------------
“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
----------------------------------------------
“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles.
----------------------------------------------
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all about Harry and Ron first lessons.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------
“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I liked Ron a lot — great with animals.” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
----------------------------------------------
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry remembered Ron telling Harry on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts , but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry and Ron walked back to the main castle for dinner, Harry and Ron pockets weighed down with rock cakes Harry and Ron ’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given Harry as much to think about as tea with Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron reasonably.
----------------------------------------------
Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time Ron’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.
----------------------------------------------
Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad caught Ron prodding Seamus’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron jumped to Harry and Ron feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
----------------------------------------------
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for Ron, and the other Gryffindors first flying lesson.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been doing Malfoy wrong for years.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled Harry up a little to take his broomstick even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to Ron mouth, but Ron’d forgotten all about a piece of steak.
----------------------------------------------
“Seeker?” Ron said.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, Ron just sat and gaped at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Never heard of a Wizard’s duel before, I suppose?” “Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around.
----------------------------------------------
Well meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
----------------------------------------------
“And what do you mean, you’re my second?” “Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting started at last on Ron cold pie.
----------------------------------------------
“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ignored Ron and spoke to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoywere saying — ” “Bet you could,” Ron muttered.
----------------------------------------------
“Good-bye,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had spent all evening giving Ron advice such as “If Ron tries to curse you, you’d better dodge he tries to curse you, because I can’t remember how to block he tries to curse you.” There was a very good chance he tries to curse you were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt Harry was pushing Harry luck, breaking another school rule today.
----------------------------------------------
“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.” They pulled on They bathrobes, picked up They wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room.
----------------------------------------------
“You!” said Ron furiously.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on,” Harry said to Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione followed Ron through the portrait hole , hissing at them like an angry goose.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s your problem,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
If Filch finds all three of us I’ll tell Filch the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.” “You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly.
----------------------------------------------
“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s for your own good, you know.” “Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves — this was a big mistake.
----------------------------------------------
“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re done for!
----------------------------------------------
“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally.
----------------------------------------------
Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Ron stared after Hermione, Ron mouth open.
----------------------------------------------
“No, We don’t mind,” Ron said.
----------------------------------------------
“You’d think We dragged Hermione along, wouldn’t you?” But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as Ron climbed back into bed.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and Harry and Ron were quite keen to have another one.
----------------------------------------------
In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but Hermione was such a bossy know-it-all that Harry and Ron saw this as an added bonus.
----------------------------------------------
All Harry and Ron really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to Harry and Ron great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Harry had difficulty hiding Harry glee as Harry handed the note to Ron to read.
----------------------------------------------
“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t allowed Harry Potter.” Ron couldn’t resist it.
----------------------------------------------
What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at HALLOWEEN Malfoy’s elbow.
----------------------------------------------
“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” Ron squeaked.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering Harry and Ron laughter at HALLOWEEN Malfoy obvious rage and confusion.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.” Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
----------------------------------------------
Harry bolted Harry dinner that evening without noticing what Harry was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
----------------------------------------------
“Wow,” Ron sighed, as his new broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione hadn’t spoken to either of Ron or Hermione was angrier about this since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
As They jostled They way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
“ Hermionel” Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron said together.
----------------------------------------------
It was the last thing Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron wanted to do, but what choice did Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron have?
----------------------------------------------
Wheeling around, Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron panic.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled the door open and Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron ran inside.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his own wand in the air.
----------------------------------------------
It was about to finish me off when They arrived.” Harry and Neville tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Neville , and Hermione moved closer together to block a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from view; Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
Snape hadn’t seen a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but Snape seemed to be looking for a reason to tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione off anyway.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione would never let Harry, Ron, and Hermione copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking Hermione to read it through, Harry, Ron, and Hermione got the right answers anyway.
----------------------------------------------
Getting up, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask Snape if Harry could have it.
----------------------------------------------
“Better you than Harry,” Ron, and Hermione said together, but Harryhad an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.
----------------------------------------------
“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them.
----------------------------------------------
“I know Harry’s not very nice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.
----------------------------------------------
“Budge up there, move along.” “Hagrid!” Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?” “Nope,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Red card!” “What are you talking about, Dean Thomas?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“In soccer you get shown the red card and you’re out of the game!” “But this isn’t soccer, Dean Thomas,” Ron reminded Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.
----------------------------------------------
“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” Ron grabbed his binoculars.
----------------------------------------------
“What should we do?” “Leave it to “.” Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
Ron turned his binoculars back on HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
his broom was vibrating so hard, his broom was almost impossible for Ron to hang on much longer.
----------------------------------------------
the whole crowd was on the whole crowd feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of the whole crowd brooms, but it was no good — every time the whole crowd got near Ron, his broom would jump higher still.
----------------------------------------------
the whole crowd dropped lower and circled beneath Ron, obviously hoping to catch Ron if Ron fell.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville, you can look!” Ron said.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was cursing your broomstick, muttering, Ron wouldn’t take his eyes off Ron.” “Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to Ron in the stands.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Ron brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.
----------------------------------------------
When Ron and his brothers left the dungeons at the end of Potions, Ron and his brothers found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.
----------------------------------------------
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking Ron head through the branches.
----------------------------------------------
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.” “Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
“WEASLEY!” Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
----------------------------------------------
“Just have to find out for we, then,” said Ron, and Ron, left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let Hagrid slip, because how else were Ron, going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?
----------------------------------------------
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles Hermione had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed He, Ron, and Hermione ’d better not ask Madam Pince where He, Ron, and Hermione could find Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
He, Ron, and Hermione were sure Madam ’d be able to tell He, Ron, and Hermione , but He, Ron, and Hermione couldn’t risk Snape hearing what He, Ron, and Hermione were up to.
----------------------------------------------
He, Ron, and Hermione had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as He, Ron, and Hermione only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising He, Ron, and Hermione ’d found nothing.
----------------------------------------------
What He, Ron, and Hermione really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down He, Ron, and Hermione necks.
----------------------------------------------
Five minutes later, Ron and his brothers joined Ron, shaking Ron and his brothers heads.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and his brothers went off to lunch.
----------------------------------------------
“And send me an owl if you find anything.” “And you could ask your parents if your parents know who Flamel is,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Once the holidays had started, Ron and his brothers were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and his brothers had the dormitory to Ron and his brothers and the common room was far emptier than usual, so Ron and his brothers were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and his brothers sat by the hour eating anything Ron and his brothers could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work.
----------------------------------------------
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess.
----------------------------------------------
Ron’s set was very old and battered.
----------------------------------------------
Like everything else Ron’s owned, Ron’s set had once belonged to someone else in Ron’s family — in this case, Ron’s grandfather.
----------------------------------------------
Ron knew old chessmen so well Ron never had trouble getting old chessmen to do what Ron wanted.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on Harry bathrobe.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got some presents!” “What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to Ron own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.
----------------------------------------------
“ Weird\ ” Ron said, “What a shape!
----------------------------------------------
This is money?” “You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?” “I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
----------------------------------------------
I told My mom you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” Ron groaned, “My mom’s made you a Weasley sweater.” Harry had torn open a very lumpy parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
----------------------------------------------
“Every year My mom makes you a Weasley sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping Ron own, “and mine’s always maroon.” “That’s really nice of My mom,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.
----------------------------------------------
Ron gasped.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve heard of those,” Ron said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” Ron said.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.” “Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.” “I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as Ron pulled it over Ron head.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother Harry , fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of Harry four-poster.
----------------------------------------------
Ron grunted in Ron sleep.
----------------------------------------------
Should Harry wake Ron?
----------------------------------------------
Something held Ron back — His father’s cloak — Ron felt that this time — the first time — Ron wanted to use it alone.
----------------------------------------------
Ron crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.
----------------------------------------------
Ron walked quickly down the corridor.
----------------------------------------------
Where should Ron go?
----------------------------------------------
Ron stopped, Ron heart racing, and thought.
----------------------------------------------
And then it came to Ron.
----------------------------------------------
He’d be able to read as long as Ron liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.
----------------------------------------------
Ron set off, drawing an Invisibility Cloak tight around Ron as Ron walked.
----------------------------------------------
“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.
----------------------------------------------
“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.” “I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.” “You can see your other brothers and everyone any old time,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you all right?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m freezing,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Just as Ronstarted moaning that Ron feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
...” “I can only see you.” “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, Harry couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ronin Harry paisley pajamas.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at Ron image.
----------------------------------------------
“Look at Ron!” Ron said.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Quick!” Ron threw an Invisibility Cloak back over their as his eyes came round the door.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Harry stood quite still, Ron and Harry thinking the same thing — did the an Invisibility Cloak work on cats?
----------------------------------------------
Come on.” And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
----------------------------------------------
“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess.
----------------------------------------------
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harryand Ron thought was very good for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harrysat down next to Ron, “I need to concern” Harry caught sight of Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“ Really break your leg,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“What happened?” Hermione asked Neville’s , leading Neville’s over to sit with Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve got to stand up to Neville, Neville!” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Then Dumbledore gently looked up at Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. “I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.” “Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told Ron to be quiet until Hermione’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
I knew it!” “Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ignored Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“The what?” said Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
----------------------------------------------
Anyone would want Snape’s.” “And no wonder we couldn’t find Nicolas Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is Ron?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d do with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t until Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m going to play,” Snape told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
I’ll show Ron and Hermione ...
----------------------------------------------
it’ll really wipe the smiles off Ron and Hermione faces if we win.” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever Harry told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry knew, when they wished Harry good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ronand Hermione were wondering whether Ron and Hermione’d ever see Harry alive again.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why Ron and Hermione looked so grim and worried, or why Ron and Hermione had Ron and Hermione brought Ron and Hermione wands to the match.
----------------------------------------------
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermionemuttered as Ron slipped Ron wand up Ron sleeve.
----------------------------------------------
“I know,” Ron snapped.
----------------------------------------------
Ouch!” Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head.
----------------------------------------------
What about you, Weasley?” Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because Weasley had hit a Bludger at Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” “What?
----------------------------------------------
Ron snapped.
----------------------------------------------
Before ” Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of Ron, wrestling Ron to the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron!
----------------------------------------------
Ron!
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
----------------------------------------------
We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back.
----------------------------------------------
“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days Harry gave Harry an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but Hermione kept nagging Harry and Ron to do the same.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s not ages, that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” “But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down Ron quill and looking longingly out of the library window.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until Ron heard Ron say, “Hagrid!
----------------------------------------------
What are you doing in the library?” Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind Ron back.
----------------------------------------------
Ron looked very out of place in Ron moleskin overcoat.
----------------------------------------------
“Jus’ lookin’,” Ron said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ what’re you lot up ter?” Ron looked suddenly suspicious.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think it had anything to do with the Sorcerer’s Stone?” “I’m going to see what section Hagrid was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough of working.
----------------------------------------------
“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Of course there are,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, “That’s — er ...” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too.
----------------------------------------------
It was driving Harry and Ron nuts.
----------------------------------------------
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to his hut.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione argued all the way to Herbologyand in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break.
----------------------------------------------
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of Ron, and Hermione lesson, the three of Ron, and Hermione dropped Ron, and Hermione trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid greeted Ron, and Hermione, looking flushed and excited.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s nearly out.” Hagrid ushered Ron, and Hermione inside.
----------------------------------------------
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione very nervous spent most of Ron, and Hermione very nervous free time in Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with Hagrid ’s.
----------------------------------------------
Where’s Mommy?” “The baby dragon’s lost The baby dragon marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I know I can’t keep Hagrid forever, but I can’t jus’ dump Hagrid, can’t.” Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie,” Ron said.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie can take care of “Charlie and then put “Charlie back in the wild!” “Brilliant!” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron appeared out of nowhere as Ron pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had been down at Hagrid hut, helping Ron feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.
----------------------------------------------
“It bit me!” Ron said, showing them Ron hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief.
----------------------------------------------
When it bit me Ron told me off for frightening .
----------------------------------------------
And when I left, Ron was singing a lullaby.” There was a tap on the dark window.
----------------------------------------------
Dear Ron, How are you?
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s not just my hand,” Ron whispered, “although that feels like it’s about to fall off.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all.
----------------------------------------------
On the contrary, Ron sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.
----------------------------------------------
“Midnight on Saturday!” Ron said in a hoarse voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” Ron, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made Ron, and Hermione leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” When Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky letter, Norbert eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for Hagrid to say good-bye to Norbert if Ron, and Hermione hadn’t been so worried about what Ron, and Hermione had to do.
----------------------------------------------
It was a very dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Harry Potter’s , we owe you one!” Only Ron stood by Only Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — no,” Only Ron admitted.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept to He, Ron, and Hermione, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.
----------------------------------------------
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy what Harry’d heard.
----------------------------------------------
“Snapedone it, then!” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“If Quirrell’s told Ron how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Maybe Snapefound out how to get past Snape without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding asking Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
That’ll take a lot of explaining.” Hermione looked convinced, but Only Ron didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Harry, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron stared at Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry and Ron were — ” Harry began, without any idea what Harry was going to say.
----------------------------------------------
Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” Harry and Ron went back to the common room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron Harry and Ron were thinking about what Harry and Ron were about to do.
----------------------------------------------
As for Harry and Harry, Harry and Ron legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without Harry and Ron noticing.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in one hand.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers nodded.
----------------------------------------------
a brilliantly lit chamber was so dark Ron and Hermione ’s cheers couldn’t see anything at all.
----------------------------------------------
But as Ron and Hermione ’s cheers stepped into a brilliantly lit chamber, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were and carved from what looked like black stone.
----------------------------------------------
Facing Ron and Hermione ’s cheers, way across a brilliantly lit chamber, were the white pieces.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Harrythink.
----------------------------------------------
Twice, Harry only just noticed in time that Harry, Ron and Hermione were in danger.
----------------------------------------------
Harry darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as Harry, Ron and Hermione had lost black ones.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got to be taken.” “NO!” Harry, Ron and Hermione shouted.
----------------------------------------------
I make my move and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” “But — of course“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” “Ron — ” “Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the Stone!” There was no alternative.
----------------------------------------------
“But five minutes only.” And Madam Pomfrey let Ron and Hermione in.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so worried — ” “The whole school’s talking about The whole school’s,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
----------------------------------------------
“So Harry’s gone?” said Ron finally.
----------------------------------------------
— ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’ ” “I always said Dumbledore was off Dumbledore rocker,” said Ron and Hermionelooking quite impressed at how crazy Dumbledore hero was.
----------------------------------------------
“So what happened to Ron and Hermione two?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met Dumbledore in the entrance hall — Dumbledore already knew — Dumbledore just said, ‘Harry’s gone after Harry, hasn’t Harry?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” “D’you think “D’you meant you to do “D’you?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
...” “Yeah, Dumbledore’s off Dumbledore rocker, all right,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” Ron went purple in the face; Ron looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
To the exam results were still to come great surprise, both Harry and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
both he and Ron had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as Even Neville was mean, might be thrown out, but Even Neville had passed, too.
----------------------------------------------
It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn’t have everything in life.
----------------------------------------------
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled People as People moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
----------------------------------------------
Some of People called: “Bye, Harry!” “See you, Harry Potter!” “Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.
----------------------------------------------
“There He, Ron, and Hermione is, Mom, there He, Ron, and Hermione is, look!” It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Neville
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Harry passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” “Oh, Neville,” Harry heard the old woman sigh.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was just taking Harrythrough the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but the compartment door wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.
----------------------------------------------
Neville, the boy who kept losing Harry Potter toad, sniffed once or twice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were followed into Harry and Ron boat by Neville and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands.
----------------------------------------------
I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.” Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under Neville’s left ear, and on “Charlie’s in Romaniasmudged nose.
----------------------------------------------
When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, his fell over on his way to the stool.
----------------------------------------------
“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, Gran brought me up and Mom’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages.
----------------------------------------------
Peeves stuck out Peeves tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head.
----------------------------------------------
They all scrambled through a round hole in the wall — Neville needed a leg up — and found They all in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
On my whistle — three — two — ” But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.
----------------------------------------------
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around his.
----------------------------------------------
All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as Harry lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing).
----------------------------------------------
It was Neville .
----------------------------------------------
Neville was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.” “Keep your voice down, Neville .
----------------------------------------------
“Fine,” said Neville , showing them.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady’s robes had barely whipped round a corner when Neville’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville’s robes’re in here somewhere,” Neville’s robes heard Harry mutter, “probably hiding.” “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, the others began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.
----------------------------------------------
Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run — Neville tripped, grabbed Ronaround the waist, and the pair of Neville’s robes toppled right into a suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along a hidden passageway and came out near they Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.
----------------------------------------------
“I think well be okay — get off Neville !” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute.
----------------------------------------------
Neville , indeed, looked as if Neville ’d never speak again.
----------------------------------------------
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.
----------------------------------------------
All Neville cared about was never going near The dog again.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If Harry hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.
----------------------------------------------
Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that Professor Flitwick thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen Professor Flitwick make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch Neville eye).
----------------------------------------------
Neville , however, was to be working with Hermione Granger.
----------------------------------------------
It was hard to tell whether Neville or Hermione was angrier about this.
----------------------------------------------
Neville , at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.
----------------------------------------------
“it’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.” “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Neville snarled.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone see here, It’s done it!” Neville was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Neville said to Harry Harry as Harry pushed Harry way into the crowded corridor, “Harry’s a nightmare, honestly.” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Harry heard you.” “So?” said Neville , but Neville looked a bit uncomfortable.
----------------------------------------------
On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Neville overheard Parvati Patil telling Harry friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
----------------------------------------------
Neville looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later the girls had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of the girls minds.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t ask me, a troll’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Neville .
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve just thought Hermione.” “What about Hermione?” “Hermione doesn’t know about the troll.” Neville bit Neville lip.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, all right,” Neville snapped.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy!” hissed Neville , pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Neville held up Percy hand.
----------------------------------------------
Neville pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward they.
----------------------------------------------
“We could lock the troll in.” “Good idea,” said Neville nervously.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, no,” said Neville , pale as the Bloody Baron.
----------------------------------------------
“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Neville , and, seizing a tap, Harry threw it as hard as Harry could against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Neville from the other side of the chamber, and Neville threw a metal pipe at a metal pipe.
----------------------------------------------
the trolldidn’t even seem to notice a metal pipe hitting a metal pipe shoulder, but a metal pipe heard the yell and paused again, turning a metal pipe ugly snout toward Neville instead, giving Harry time to run around a metal pipe.
----------------------------------------------
the troll berserk roared again and started toward Neville , who was nearest and had no way to escape.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had sunk to the third floor in fright; Neville pulled out Neville own wand — not knowing what Neville was going to do Neville heard Neville cry the first spell that came into Neville head: “Wingardium Leviosal” its club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s head.
----------------------------------------------
Neville was standing there with his own wand still raised, staring at what Neville had done.
----------------------------------------------
“Is it — dead?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.” Neville bent down and pulled his own wand out of the troll’s nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Urgh — troll boogers.” Neville wiped it on the troll’s trousers.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was looking at Neville and Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wished Neville would put his own wand down.
----------------------------------------------
“I went looking for even a troll because I — I thought I could deal with even a troll on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about even a troll.” Neville dropped his own wand.
----------------------------------------------
Harrystuck his own wand up Harry nose and Neville knocked his own wand out with his own wand own club.
----------------------------------------------
It was about to finish me off when They arrived.” Harry and Neville tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Neville grumbled.
----------------------------------------------
“Five, you mean, once Neville ’s taken off Hermione ’s.” “Good of Neville to get We out of trouble like that,” Neville admitted.
----------------------------------------------
“Mind you, We did save Neville .” “Neville might not have needed saving if We hadn’t locked the thing in with Neville ,” Harry reminded Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Neville had saved Hermione from the mountain troll, and Hermione was much nicer for it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Neville , and Hermione moved closer together to block a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from view; Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
Neville was snoring loudly, but Harrycouldn’t sleep.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville, you can look!” Ron said.
----------------------------------------------
Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.
----------------------------------------------
If I back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.” At that moment Neville toppled into the common room.
----------------------------------------------
How Neville had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyoneFilch’s guess, because Neville legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse.
----------------------------------------------
Neville must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s legs sprang apart and Neville’s got to Neville’s feet, trembling.
----------------------------------------------
“What happened?” Hermione asked Neville’s , leading Neville’s over to sit with Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily.
----------------------------------------------
“I met Neville outside the library.
----------------------------------------------
Neville said Neville’d been looking for someone to practice that on.” “Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“Report Neville!” Neville shook Neville head.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t want more trouble,” Neville mumbled.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve got to stand up to Neville, Neville!” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of Neville and make it easier.” “There’s no need to tell me I’ve not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Nevillechoked out.
----------------------------------------------
Harry gave it to Neville, who looked as though Harry might cry.
----------------------------------------------
In stinking Slytherin.” Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as Slytherin unwrapped the frog.
----------------------------------------------
D’you want the card, you collect the card, don’t you?” As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the card.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why Ron and Hermione looked so grim and worried, or why Ron and Hermione had Ron and Hermione brought Ron and Hermione wands to the match.
----------------------------------------------
They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if Snape showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m worth twelve of you, ” Malfoy,” Neville stammered.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“And I gave ” Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
----------------------------------------------
When Professor McGonagallappeared, Professor McGonagall was leading Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment Neville saw the other two.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed the story, too?” Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell Harry without words that this wasn’t true, because Nevillewas looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
Poor, blundering Neville Harry knew what it must have cost Harry to try and find Neville was looking stunned and hurt in the dark, to warn Neville was looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
Harry knew Neville, like Harry, was dreading the dawn.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the Quidditch team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if The rest of the team had to speak about Harry, The rest of the team called Harry “the Seeker.” Hermione and Neville were suffering, too.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione and Neville didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because Hermione and Neville weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to Hermione and Neville, either.
----------------------------------------------
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table.
----------------------------------------------
At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Only Ronin the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Neville kept sniffing.
----------------------------------------------
Well, think again, boy — that oaf’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.” At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in Neville tracks.
----------------------------------------------
“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.” Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.
----------------------------------------------
“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other.
----------------------------------------------
A little way into The forest they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville ...
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with Fang.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed Neville as a joke.
----------------------------------------------
Right, ’m’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with Neville an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot.
----------------------------------------------
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by Harry old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though Neville’d been making another bid for freedom.
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting cloak behind Harry back.
----------------------------------------------
Neville stared at their guilty faces.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re going out again,” Neville said.
----------------------------------------------
Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door.
----------------------------------------------
“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling Neville to do something desperate.
----------------------------------------------
“I won’t let you do it,” Neville said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll — I’ll fight you!” Neville,” Harry exploded, “get away from the portrait hole and don’t be an idiot — ” “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” Neville took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising Neville fists.
----------------------------------------------
“Do something,” Neville said desperately.
----------------------------------------------
Neville,” Hermione said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” Hermione raised Hermione wand.
----------------------------------------------
“Petrificus Totalusl” Hermione cried, pointing it at Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s arms snapped to Neville’s sides.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s legs sprang together.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s whole body rigid, Neville’s swayed where Neville’s stood and then fell flat on Neville’s face, stiff as a board.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ran to turn Neville’s over.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s jaws were jammed together so Neville’s couldn’t speak.
----------------------------------------------
Only Neville’s eyes were moving, looking at Only his eyes in horror.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Harry as they stepped over Harry and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen.
----------------------------------------------
I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.” Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Neville had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.
----------------------------------------------
Even Neville scraped through, Even Neville good Herbology mark making up for Even Neville abysmal Potions one.
----------------------------------------------
both he and Ron had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as Even Neville was mean, might be thrown out, but Even Neville had passed, too.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.

Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.
----------------------------------------------
Percy the Prefect got up and shook Harry hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Harry Potter!
----------------------------------------------
“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).
----------------------------------------------
And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
----------------------------------------------
At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore conducted only the Weasley twins last few lines with his wand and when only the Weasley twins had finished, Professor Dumbledore was one of those who clapped loudest.
----------------------------------------------
the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of The ghosts.
----------------------------------------------
The students all hated anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins), and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.
----------------------------------------------
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, them had noticed that a funny smell hung around Quirrell’s turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that Quirrell was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever Quirrell went.
----------------------------------------------
“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of Fred and George Weasley started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.” Wood was now looking as though all Charlie Weasley dreams had come true at once.
----------------------------------------------
“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Harry Potter?” Charlie Weasley asked excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie Weasley’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep Wood a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.
----------------------------------------------
“Fred and George Weasley haven’t won since Charlie Weasley left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant.
----------------------------------------------
You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when Wood told Fred and George Weasley.” “Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood reckons Wood The boy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in we first week.
----------------------------------------------
See you.” Fred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“Comets look flashy, but Comets’re not in the same league as the Nimbus.” “What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the handle,” HALLOWEEN Malfoy snapped back.
----------------------------------------------
“The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s the Weasley twinsjob to protect the Weasley twins side from the Bludgers and try and knock the Weasley twins toward the other team.
----------------------------------------------
“I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and Charlie Weasley could have played for England if Charlie Weasley hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” Perhaps it was because Charlie Weasley was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all Charlie Weasley homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when Charlie Weasley realized that Charlie Weasley’d already been at Hogwarts two months.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie Weasley lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.
----------------------------------------------
“This is it.” “The big one,” said Fred Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
Once Harry caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting Harry way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
----------------------------------------------
The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that the Weasley twins followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of Quirrell turban.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Ron brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley?
----------------------------------------------
“WEASLEY!” Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.
----------------------------------------------
“Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more.
----------------------------------------------
I told My mom you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” Ron groaned, “My mom’s made you a Weasley sweater.” Harry had torn open a very lumpy parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
----------------------------------------------
“Every year My mom makes you a Weasley sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping Ron own, “and mine’s always maroon.” “That’s really nice of My mom,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas!” “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.
----------------------------------------------
But we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and Forge.” “What’s all this noise?” Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving.
----------------------------------------------
Weasley had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping Weasley presents as Weasley, too, carried a lumpy sweater over Weasley arm, which Fred seized.
----------------------------------------------
Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees his standing alone, the best of all of Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers.
----------------------------------------------
Filch’s refereeing this time, and Filch’s’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” George Weasley really did fall off George Weasley broom at these words.
----------------------------------------------
“Filch’s George Weasley ever refereed a Quidditch match?
----------------------------------------------
Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.” “The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
What about you, Weasley?” Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because Weasley had hit a Bludger at Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Snape’s obviously spotted some money on the ground!” said ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.
----------------------------------------------
Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” Harry and Ron went back to the common room.
----------------------------------------------
I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.
----------------------------------------------
No doubt your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley thought it would amuse you.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger have been extremely worried.” “But sir, the Stone — ” “I see you are not to be distracted.
----------------------------------------------
“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” Ron went purple in the face; Ron looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
----------------------------------------------
“There He, Ron, and Hermione is, Mom, there He, Ron, and Hermione is, look!” It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
I can see “Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” Fred Weasley smiled down at them.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.
----------------------------------------------
“You must be Harry’s family!” said Fred Weasley.

Nicolas Flamel
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
You forget that dog, an’ you forget what His broom’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” “Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?” Hagrid looked furious with Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who Harry is.” “You what?” Hagrid looked shocked.
----------------------------------------------
it’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.” “we just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“we must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find Nicolas Flamel anywhere — just give we a hint — I know I’ve read Nicolas Flamel name somewhere.” “I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly.
----------------------------------------------
The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Nicolas Flamel might have done to get Nicolas Flamel into a book.
----------------------------------------------
Nicolas Flamel wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time ; Nicolas Flamel was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed He, Ron, and Hermione ’d better not ask Madam Pince where He, Ron, and Hermione could find Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that Filch had hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
----------------------------------------------
I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read the name on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore gently is particularly famous for Dumbledore gently defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ Hermione jumped to Hermione .
----------------------------------------------
“Nicolas Flamel,” Hermione whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\” This didn’t have quite the effect Hermione’d expected.
----------------------------------------------
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera loverenjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
----------------------------------------------
Anyone would want Snape’s.” “And no wonder we couldn’t find Nicolas Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s not ages, that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” “But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Yer not still lookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?” “Oh, we found out who Nicolas Flamel is ages ago,” said Ronimpressively.
----------------------------------------------
“But your friend — Nicolas Flamel — ” “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.

----------------------------------------------
Ron was just taking Harrythrough the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but the compartment door wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy thought there were “ more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
----------------------------------------------
No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells No one’d learned and wondering which one No one’d need.
----------------------------------------------
By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to only Hermione Granger match; Professor Binns showed my class how my class had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.
----------------------------------------------
only Hermione Granger was on the edge of only Hermione Granger seat and looked desperate to start proving that only Hermione Granger wasn’t a dunderhead.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Professor Snape was.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Hermione Granger’s hadn’t moved at all.
----------------------------------------------
“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s was going to be expelled, Hermione Granger’s just knew it.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s wanted to say something to defend Hermione Granger’s, but there seemed to be something wrong with Hermione Granger’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind Hermione Granger’s.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe Hermione Granger’s was taking Professor McGonagall to Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps Professor McGonagall could be Hermione Granger’s assistant.
----------------------------------------------
It was Hermione Granger.

A lamp was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.

“Would you mind leaving while — Crabbe and Malfoy change?” “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were followed into Harry and Ron boat by Neville and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells No one’d learned and wondering which one No one’d need.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heard Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside.
----------------------------------------------
“Granger, Hermione!” Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed a pointed wizard’s hateagerly on Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).

Harryglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as Harry was; Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air.
----------------------------------------------
“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” Tut ignored Hermione ’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it would go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
----------------------------------------------
“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
----------------------------------------------
“Sit down,” Professor Snape snapped at Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Professor Snape was.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.

----------------------------------------------
“Go back to bed!” “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — your brother’s a prefect, your brother’d put a stop to this.” Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione followed Ron through the portrait hole , hissing at them like an angry goose.
----------------------------------------------
Hermionehad turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady the Fat Lady to get back inside and found Hermione facing an empty painting.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve got to go, We’re going to be late.” They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with They.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened Hermione mouth, perhaps to tell Ronexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harryhissed at Hermione to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled.
----------------------------------------------
“If any dog needs exercise, that one does.” Hermione had got both Hermione breath and Hermione bad temper back again.
----------------------------------------------
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” Hermione snapped.

Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Ron stared after Hermione, Ron mouth open.
----------------------------------------------
“You’d think We dragged Hermione along, wouldn’t you?” But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as Ron climbed back into bed.
----------------------------------------------
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but Hermione was such a bossy know-it-all that Harry and Ron saw this as an added bonus.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package from Harry in Harry’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.” Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
----------------------------------------------
Neville , however, was to be working with Hermione Granger.
----------------------------------------------
It was hard to tell whether Neville or Hermione was angrier about this.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione hadn’t spoken to either of Ron or Hermione was angrier about this since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of Hermione gown, flicked his wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ “Wingardium LeviosaV rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above “Wingardium LeviosaV heads.
----------------------------------------------
It was Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry must’ve noticed Harry’s got no friends.” Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon.
----------------------------------------------
On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Neville overheard Parvati Patil telling Harry friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
----------------------------------------------
Neville looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later the girls had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of the girls minds.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve just thought Hermione.” “What about Hermione?” “Hermione doesn’t know about the troll.” Neville bit Neville lip.
----------------------------------------------
the troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull Hermione toward the door, but Hermione couldn’t move, Hermione was still flat against the wall, Hermione mouth open with terror.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had sunk to the third floor in fright; Neville pulled out Neville own wand — not knowing what Neville was going to do Neville heard Neville cry the first spell that came into Neville head: “Wingardium Leviosal” its club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s head.
----------------------------------------------
It was Hermione who spoke first.
----------------------------------------------
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” Hermione had managed to get to his feet at last.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here Hermione was, pretending Hermione had, to get them out of trouble.
----------------------------------------------
Students are finishing the feast in Students Houses.” Hermione left.
----------------------------------------------
“Five, you mean, once Neville ’s taken off Hermione ’s.” “Good of Neville to get We out of trouble like that,” Neville admitted.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for Everyone .
----------------------------------------------
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all Harry homework without Harry now had Hermione as a friend, what with all the last- minute Quidditch practice Wood was making Quidditch practice Wood do.
----------------------------------------------
Harry now had Hermione as a friend had also lent Harry Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Neville had saved Hermione from the mountain troll, and Hermione was much nicer for it.
----------------------------------------------
The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and Hermione had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Neville , and Hermione moved closer together to block a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from view; Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
Snape hadn’t seen a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but Snape seemed to be looking for a reason to tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione off anyway.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione would never let Harry, Ron, and Hermione copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking Hermione to read it through, Harry, Ron, and Hermione got the right answers anyway.
----------------------------------------------
Getting up, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask Snape if Harry could have it.
----------------------------------------------
“Better you than Harry,” Ron, and Hermione said together, but Harryhad an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.
----------------------------------------------
And I’d bet my broomstick Harry let that troll in, to make a diversion!” Hermione’s eyes were wide.
----------------------------------------------
“I know Harry’s not very nice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.” “I don’t want anything.” “Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.
----------------------------------------------
Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.
----------------------------------------------
“Budge up there, move along.” “Hagrid!” Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, Hermione started looking frantically at the whole crowd.
----------------------------------------------
“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” Ron grabbed his binoculars.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“What should we do?” “Leave it to “.” Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, Snape’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did Snape just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Just one,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
it’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.” “we just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles Hermione had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed He, Ron, and Hermione ’d better not ask Madam Pince where He, Ron, and Hermione could find Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
He, Ron, and Hermione were sure Madam ’d be able to tell He, Ron, and Hermione , but He, Ron, and Hermione couldn’t risk Snape hearing what He, Ron, and Hermione were up to.
----------------------------------------------
He, Ron, and Hermione had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as He, Ron, and Hermione only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising He, Ron, and Hermione ’d found nothing.
----------------------------------------------
What He, Ron, and Hermione really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down He, Ron, and Hermione necks.
----------------------------------------------
“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“It’d be safe to ask your parents.” “Very safe, as your parents’re both dentists,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve heard of those,” Ron said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess.
----------------------------------------------
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harryand Ron thought was very good for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.
----------------------------------------------
“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse.
----------------------------------------------
“What happened?” Hermione asked Neville’s , leading Neville’s over to sit with Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Neville said Neville’d been looking for someone to practice that on.” “Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt in the pocket of Harry robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given Harry for Another Christmas.
----------------------------------------------
Then Dumbledore gently looked up at Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read the name on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore gently is particularly famous for Dumbledore gently defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ Hermione jumped to Hermione .
----------------------------------------------
Hermione hadn’t looked so excited since they’d gotten back the marks for they very first piece of homework.
----------------------------------------------
“Stay there!” Hermione said, and Hermione sprinted up the stairs to the girls’ dormitories.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. “I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.” “Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told Ron to be quiet until Hermione’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
At last Hermione found what Hermione was looking for.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ignored Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Nicolas Flamel,” Hermione whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\” This didn’t have quite the effect Hermione’d expected.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m going to play,” Snape told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
I’ll show Ron and Hermione ...
----------------------------------------------
it’ll really wipe the smiles off Ron and Hermione faces if we win.” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever Harry told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry knew, when they wished Harry good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ronand Hermione were wondering whether Ron and Hermione’d ever see Harry alive again.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why Ron and Hermione looked so grim and worried, or why Ron and Hermione had Ron and Hermione brought Ron and Hermione wands to the match.
----------------------------------------------
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” Snape told Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” “What?
----------------------------------------------
Hermione stood up, Hermione crossed fingers in Hermione mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
----------------------------------------------
Jc Jc Jc “Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, however, had more on Hermione mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all Hermione notes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but Hermione kept nagging Harry and Ron to do the same.
----------------------------------------------
“Hermione, the exams are ages away.” “Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s not ages, that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” “But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
the exams’re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into me.” Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements.
----------------------------------------------
“What was Hagrid hiding behind Hagrid ?” said Hermione thoughtfully.
----------------------------------------------
us kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks, to make Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks forget.” “So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell We, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
----------------------------------------------
“We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
Think havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.” “But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” Hermione said.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione wouldn’t hear of his hut.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, how many times in our lives are our going to see a dragon hatching?” “our’ve got lessons, our’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone finds out what someone ’s doing — ” “Shut up!” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione argued all the way to Herbologyand in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break.
----------------------------------------------
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of Ron, and Hermione lesson, the three of Ron, and Hermione dropped Ron, and Hermione trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid greeted Ron, and Hermione, looking flushed and excited.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s nearly out.” Hagrid ushered Ron, and Hermione inside.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from Hagrid face — Hagrid leapt to Hagrid feet and ran to the window.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione very nervous spent most of Ron, and Hermione very nervous free time in Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with Hagrid ’s.
----------------------------------------------
Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” Ron, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made Ron, and Hermione leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” When Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky letter, Norbert eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for Hagrid to say good-bye to Norbert if Ron, and Hermione hadn’t been so worried about what Ron, and Hermione had to do.
----------------------------------------------
It was a very dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Mommy will never forget you!” How Harry and Hermione managed to get a large crate back up to the castle, Harry and Hermione never knew.
----------------------------------------------
Midnight ticked nearer as Harry and Hermione heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.
----------------------------------------------
“Nearly there!” Harry panted as Harry and Hermione reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.
----------------------------------------------
Then a sudden movement ahead of Harry and Hermione made Harry and Hermione almost drop a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
Forgetting that Harry and Hermione were already invisible, Harry and Hermione shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione did a sort of jig.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie’s friends showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so Charlie’s friends could suspend Norbert between Charlie’s friends.
----------------------------------------------
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked Harry and Hermione very much.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione slipped back down the spiral staircase, Harry and Hermione hearts as light as Harry and Hermione hands, now that Norbert was off Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — what could spoil Harry and Hermione happiness?
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was trembling.
----------------------------------------------
Explain yourselves.” It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s question.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the Quidditch team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if The rest of the team had to speak about Harry, The rest of the team called Harry “the Seeker.” Hermione and Neville were suffering, too.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione and Neville didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because Hermione and Neville weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to Hermione and Neville, either.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had stopped drawing attention to Hermione in class, keeping Hermione head down and working in silence.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept to He, Ron, and Hermione, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.
----------------------------------------------
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy what Harry’d heard.
----------------------------------------------
“If Quirrell’s told Ron how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
So what do we do, Harry?” The light of adventure was kindling again in Harry’seyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
That’ll take a lot of explaining.” Hermione looked convinced, but Only Ron didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table.
----------------------------------------------
’d half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but Hermione didn’t say a word.
----------------------------------------------
Like Harry, Hermione felt they deserved what they’d got.
----------------------------------------------
All right, Harry, Hermione?” “I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” , Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” ’re here to be punished, after all.” “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
----------------------------------------------
“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other.
----------------------------------------------
A little way into The forest they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
----------------------------------------------
“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted Harry and Hermione off the path behind a towering oak.
----------------------------------------------
The three of Harry and Hermione listened.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.
----------------------------------------------
This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the way.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s a centaur.” “We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.
----------------------------------------------
And do you learn much, up at the school?” “Erm — ” “A bit,” said Hermione timidly.
----------------------------------------------
We’ll be off, then.” Harry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, staring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked Harry and Hermione view.
----------------------------------------------
Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” “Are there many of Harry and Hermione in here?” asked Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Keep Harry and Hermione to Harry and Hermione mostly, but Harry and Hermione’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione’re deep, mind, centaurs ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione know things ...
----------------------------------------------
the unicorns had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
“You don’t think the unicorns’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Right, ’m’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with Neville an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, are you all right?” Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
In a matter of seconds, though, Harry was wide- eyed as Harry began to tell Harry and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
----------------------------------------------
Well, I suppose Bane be happy.” Hermione looked very frightened, but Hermione had a word of comfort.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harryhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on they foreheads, but Harry and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about The Sorcerer’s Stone as HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds.
----------------------------------------------
“I needn’t have learned about the Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Harry said this made Harry feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
----------------------------------------------
“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.
----------------------------------------------
HarryHarry, relax, Hermione ’s right, The unicorn’s dead safe as long as Dumbledore’s around.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.
----------------------------------------------
Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Harry, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
“us want to see Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Harry thought.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.” “But what can we — ” Hermione gasped.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, you’d better do that.” “Why me?” “It’s obvious,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
’ ” “Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but Hermione agreed to go and watch out for Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
----------------------------------------------
“You can’t!” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.
----------------------------------------------
“All — all three of us?” “Oh, come off it, you don’t think us’d let you go alone?” “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly.
----------------------------------------------
...” “But if us get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break.
----------------------------------------------
“No, no, no,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m ready!” Harry turned to Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione stepped forward.
----------------------------------------------
Neville,” Hermione said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” Hermione raised Hermione wand.
----------------------------------------------
“Petrificus Totalusl” Hermione cried, pointing it at Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ran to turn Neville’s over.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably.
----------------------------------------------
“We’re coming,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s that at it feet?” Hermione whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Want to go first, Hermione?” “No, I don’t!” “All right.” Harry gritted Harry teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
----------------------------------------------
“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.
----------------------------------------------
Give the flute to Hermione so Hermione can keep Hermione asleep.” Harry handed the flute over.
----------------------------------------------
In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, the dog fell back into the dog deep sleep.
----------------------------------------------
Come on, Hermione!” The distant music stopped.
----------------------------------------------
There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione landed on Harry’s other side.
----------------------------------------------
“We must be miles under the school,” Hermione said.
----------------------------------------------
“Lucky\” shrieked Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Look at you both!” Hermione leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had to struggle because the moment Hermione had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around Hermione ankles.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had managed to free Hermione before the plant got a firm grip on Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Now Hermione watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off the two boys, but the more the two boys strained against the, the tighter and faster the plant wound around the two boys.
----------------------------------------------
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered the two boys.
----------------------------------------------
“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermionecried, wringing Hermione hands.
----------------------------------------------
“ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and Hermione whipped out Hermione wand, waved her wand, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames Hermione had used on Snape at the plant.
----------------------------------------------
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as Harry joined Hermione by the wall, wiping sweat off Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
They tugged and heaved at a heavy wooden door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm.
----------------------------------------------
can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, you come at his broom from above Hermione, stay below and stop his broom from going down — and I’ll try and catch his broom.
----------------------------------------------
Right, NOW!” Harry dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione ’s cheers echoed around a brilliantly lit chamber.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in one hand.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers nodded.
----------------------------------------------
a brilliantly lit chamber was so dark Ron and Hermione ’s cheers couldn’t see anything at all.
----------------------------------------------
But as Ron and Hermione ’s cheers stepped into a brilliantly lit chamber, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were and carved from what looked like black stone.
----------------------------------------------
Facing Ron and Hermione ’s cheers, way across a brilliantly lit chamber, were the white pieces.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Harry and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.
----------------------------------------------
“How?” said Hermione nervously.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Harrythink.
----------------------------------------------
“Just tell we what to do.” “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” “What about you?” “I’m going to be a knight,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned a knight, a bishop, and a castle backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Harry, and Hermione took.
----------------------------------------------
“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.” Every time one of their men was lost, the white piecesshowed no mercy.
----------------------------------------------
Twice, Harry only just noticed in time that Harry, Ron and Hermione were in danger.
----------------------------------------------
Harry darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as Harry, Ron and Hermione had lost black ones.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got to be taken.” “NO!” Harry, Ron and Hermione shouted.
----------------------------------------------
“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.
----------------------------------------------
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, us give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in dwarf nor giant insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste twins, though different at first sight Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that Hermione was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
----------------------------------------------
“Brilliant,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t ’d be stuck in here forever.” “But so will we, won’t we?” “Of course not,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get we safely through the black fire, and one will get we back through the purple.” “But how do we know which to drink?” “Give me a minute.” Hermione read this paper several times.
----------------------------------------------
Then Hermione walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to Hermione and pointing at them.
----------------------------------------------
At last, Hermione clapped Hermione hands.
----------------------------------------------
“Got her hands,” Hermione said.
----------------------------------------------
“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?” Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.
----------------------------------------------
“I might get lucky again.” Hermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Hermionel” “Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” “I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as Hermione let go of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Me!” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“You are sure which is which, aren’t you?” “Positive,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.
----------------------------------------------
“No — but It’s like ice.” “Quick, go, before It wears off.” “Good luck — take care — ” “GO!” Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
----------------------------------------------
You got Hermione’s owl?” “We must have crossed in midair.
----------------------------------------------
“But five minutes only.” And Madam Pomfrey let Ron and Hermione in.
----------------------------------------------
“Harryl” Hermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” again, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry head was still very sore.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
----------------------------------------------
“So what happened to Ron and Hermione two?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” “Well,” Hermione exploded, “if “D’you did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” “No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger .
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville.
----------------------------------------------
To the exam results were still to come great surprise, both Harry and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.
----------------------------------------------
“There He, Ron, and Hermione is, Mom, there He, Ron, and Hermione is, look!” It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“See you over the summer, then.” “Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------

Gryffindor
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Albus Dumbledore was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“your Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where Their are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find those of wit and learning kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve Those cunning folk ends.
----------------------------------------------
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see “Charlie’s in Romania twin brothers catcalling.
----------------------------------------------
“Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before a pointed wizard’s hat declared him a Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted a pointed wizard’s hat.
----------------------------------------------
When a pointed wizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still wearing a pointed wizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a pointed wizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when ” Malfoy name was called and got ” Malfoy wish at once: a pointed wizard’s hat had barely touched ” Malfoy when a pointed wizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join ” Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” Harry heard a pointed wizard’s hat shout the last word to the whole hall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry took off a pointed wizard’s hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry crossed Harry fingers under the table and a second later a pointed wizard’s hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into a large gold chair next to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” “I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Off you trot!” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.
----------------------------------------------
They all scrambled through a round hole in the wall — Neville needed a leg up — and found They all in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns was head of Gryffindor House, but Professor Binns hadn’t stopped Professor Binns from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in Harry’s very first week — why did Professor Snape hate Professor Snape so much?
----------------------------------------------
Or at least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.
----------------------------------------------
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall explained.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.
----------------------------------------------
“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be.
----------------------------------------------
“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.” They pulled on They bathrobes, picked up They wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind.
----------------------------------------------
“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall .
----------------------------------------------
If you’re not hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
You each win Gryffindor five points.
----------------------------------------------
On Saturday, Harrywould be playing in Harry first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
If Gryffindor won, Gryffindor would move up into second place in the House Championship.
----------------------------------------------
Five points from Gryffindor.” “He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.
----------------------------------------------
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening.
----------------------------------------------
OUT!” Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.
----------------------------------------------
“This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to — Marcus Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
— Marcus Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.” It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past Harry head, that it happened.
----------------------------------------------
Harrytried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — Harry had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then Harry realized that His broom was completely out of Harry control.
----------------------------------------------
“ didn’t catch it, nearly swallowed it,” — Marcus Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.
----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
“Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more.
----------------------------------------------
Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, Harry and the Weasleys returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in Harry new chess set by losing spectacularly to RonRon.
----------------------------------------------
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower ’d stolen his prefect badge.
----------------------------------------------
Filch’s refereeing this time, and Filch’s’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” George Weasley really did fall off George Weasley broom at these words.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess.
----------------------------------------------
If I back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.” At that moment Neville toppled into the common room.
----------------------------------------------
Neville must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of Neville and make it easier.” “There’s no need to tell me I’ve not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Nevillechoked out.
----------------------------------------------
“The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it?
----------------------------------------------
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said ” Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor in the lead.
----------------------------------------------
He’d done Gryffindor in the lead, Harry’d shown Snape.
----------------------------------------------
As for you, Harry Potter’s , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this.
----------------------------------------------
All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.” “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.” A hundred and fifty points lost.
----------------------------------------------
That put Gryffindor in last place.
----------------------------------------------
In one night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup.
----------------------------------------------
What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done?
----------------------------------------------
And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can Gryffindor?” Harry flushed.
----------------------------------------------
If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor!
----------------------------------------------
D’you think D’you’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup?
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling Neville to do something desperate.
----------------------------------------------
All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, Snape did make Snape unpopular .
----------------------------------------------
“I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” Quirrell cursed again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.” The din was deafening.
----------------------------------------------
Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.” Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
Neville had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.
----------------------------------------------
In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took the huge Slytherin serpent place.
----------------------------------------------

*************************************************
Crabbe
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.
----------------------------------------------
“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than Harry felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than Harry or Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Scabbers the rat was hanging off Scabbers finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbersround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of — Crabbe and Malfoy disappeared at once.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy thought there were “ more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve met Draco Malfoy before?” Harry explained about — Crabbe and Malfoy meeting in Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
“— Crabbe and Malfoy were some of the first to come back to — Crabbe and Malfoy side after You- Know-Who disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
Said — Crabbe and Malfoy’d been bewitched.
----------------------------------------------
“Can — Crabbe and Malfoy help you with something?” “You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and the conductor says — Crabbe and Malfoy’re nearly there.
----------------------------------------------
You’ll be in trouble before — Crabbe and Malfoy even get there!” Scabbers has been fighting, not — Crabbe and Malfoy,” said Ron, scowling at her.
----------------------------------------------
“Would you mind leaving while — Crabbe and Malfoy change?” “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice.
----------------------------------------------
When a pointed wizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still wearing a pointed wizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a pointed wizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when ” Malfoy name was called and got ” Malfoy wish at once: a pointed wizard’s hat had barely touched ” Malfoy when a pointed wizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join ” Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Our new — celebrity.” Draco Malfoy and Draco Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands.
----------------------------------------------
Harrytried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.
----------------------------------------------
“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind he.
----------------------------------------------
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
See you.” Fred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of teachers could do more than crack teachers knuckles and scowl.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m he second, who’s yours?” Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing Crabbe and Goyle up.
----------------------------------------------
“Crabbe,” he said.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet.
----------------------------------------------
The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught Malfoy and Crabbe.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy and Crabbe edged along the walls, keeping Malfoy and Crabbe eyes on the doors at either end of the room.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve never even touched one.” They left the Great Hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before They first class, but halfway across the entrance hall They found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
Move along, all of you.” Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“And I gave ” Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
us’ve eaten all us food and you still seem to have some.” Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron leapt forward, but before Ron’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.
----------------------------------------------
Scabbers the rat was hanging off Scabbers finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbersround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of — Crabbe and Malfoy disappeared at once.

“I’ve never even touched one.” They left the Great Hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before They first class, but halfway across the entrance hall They found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
Move along, all of you.” Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“And I gave ” Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
----------------------------------------------
both he and Ron had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as Even Neville was mean, might be thrown out, but Even Neville had passed, too.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Malfoy
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.
----------------------------------------------
Draco Malfoy looked at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in Draco Malfoy pale cheeks.
----------------------------------------------
Scabbers the rat was hanging off Scabbers finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbersround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of — Crabbe and Malfoy disappeared at once.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy thought there were “ more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve met Draco Malfoy before?” Harry explained about — Crabbe and Malfoy meeting in Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
“— Crabbe and Malfoy were some of the first to come back to — Crabbe and Malfoy side after You- Know-Who disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
Said — Crabbe and Malfoy’d been bewitched.
----------------------------------------------
“Can — Crabbe and Malfoy help you with something?” “You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and the conductor says — Crabbe and Malfoy’re nearly there.
----------------------------------------------
You’ll be in trouble before — Crabbe and Malfoy even get there!” Scabbers has been fighting, not — Crabbe and Malfoy,” said Ron, scowling at her.
----------------------------------------------
“Would you mind leaving while — Crabbe and Malfoy change?” “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice.
----------------------------------------------
When a pointed wizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still wearing a pointed wizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a pointed wizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when ” Malfoy name was called and got ” Malfoy wish at once: a pointed wizard’s hat had barely touched ” Malfoy when a pointed wizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join ” Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
Our new — celebrity.” Draco Malfoy and Draco Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands.
----------------------------------------------
Harrytried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed Professor Snape horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon.
----------------------------------------------
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL Harry had never believed Harry would meet a boy Harry hated more than Dudley, but that was before Harry met Draco Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much.
----------------------------------------------
To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.” Harry had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
----------------------------------------------
“Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good Malfoy is at Quidditch, but I bet thatSeamus’s all talk.” Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycomplained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with Malfoy narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, Malfoy’d spent most of Malfoy childhood zooming around the countryside on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie’s eagle owl was always bringing Malfoy ’s eagle owl packages of sweets from home, which Harry opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s going on?” “Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrallback on the table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been doing Malfoy wrong for years.
----------------------------------------------
No sooner were out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.
----------------------------------------------
“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.
----------------------------------------------
“Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass.
----------------------------------------------
“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy smiled nastily.
----------------------------------------------
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?” “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto Harry broomstick and taken off.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned Harry sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy looked stunned.
----------------------------------------------
“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off his broom!” “Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned forward and grasped his broom tightly in both hands, and his broom shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
----------------------------------------------
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
----------------------------------------------
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
See you.” Fred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m he second, who’s yours?” Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing Crabbe and Goyle up.
----------------------------------------------
Well meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
----------------------------------------------
The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other.
----------------------------------------------
On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet.
----------------------------------------------
The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught Malfoy and Crabbe.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy and Crabbe edged along the walls, keeping Malfoy and Crabbe eyes on the doors at either end of the room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry took out Harry wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had only just raised his wand when them heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was never going to meet you Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped someone off.” Harry thought Harry was probably right, but Harry wasn’t going to tell Harry that.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
All Harry and Ron really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to Harry and Ron great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt the package from Harry.
----------------------------------------------
What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Comets look flashy, but Comets’re not in the same league as the Nimbus.” “What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the handle,” HALLOWEEN Malfoy snapped back.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at HALLOWEEN Malfoy’s elbow.
----------------------------------------------
“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said HALLOWEEN Malfoy quickly.
----------------------------------------------
And what model is it?” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face.
----------------------------------------------
“And it’s really thanks to HALLOWEEN Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” HALLOWEEN Malfoy added.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering Harry and Ron laughter at HALLOWEEN Malfoy obvious rage and confusion.
----------------------------------------------
“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.” He was looking over at Harry as He spoke.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.
----------------------------------------------
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.” “Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
“WEASLEY!” Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy was insultin’ Malfoy family.” “Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said Snape silkily.
----------------------------------------------
Move along, all of you.” Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and his brothers sat by the hour eating anything Ron and his brothers could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work.
----------------------------------------------
“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of Neville and make it easier.” “There’s no need to tell me I’ve not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Nevillechoked out.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
And where’s Malfoy?
----------------------------------------------
They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if Snape showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
----------------------------------------------
It was Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said ” Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m worth twelve of you, ” Malfoy,” Neville stammered.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” “What?
----------------------------------------------
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Snape’s obviously spotted some money on the ground!” said ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Before ” Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of Ron, wrestling Ron to the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“And I gave ” Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy was only a few feet away and Malfoy had stopped dead to listen.
----------------------------------------------
How much had Malfoy heard?
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy had seen The baby dragon.
----------------------------------------------
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous.
----------------------------------------------
Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey Malfoy wanted to borrow one of my books so Malfoy could come and have a good laugh at Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” Ron, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.
----------------------------------------------
“Detention!” Malfoy shouted.
----------------------------------------------
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
----------------------------------------------
“Malfoy’s got detention!
----------------------------------------------
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbertthrashing about in a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — what could spoil Harry and Hermione happiness?
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
You fed Malfoy some cock-and- bull story about a dragon, trying to get Malfoy out of bed and into trouble.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve already caught Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.
----------------------------------------------
“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading Malfoy had gotten a detention, too outside.
----------------------------------------------
“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you, eh?” Harry said, leering at Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.
----------------------------------------------
Well, think again, boy — that oaf’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.” At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in Neville tracks.
----------------------------------------------
“the forest ?” Malfoy repeated, and Malfoy didn’t sound quite as cool as usual.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Go on!” Malfoy didn’t move.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped Malfoy gaze.
----------------------------------------------
Follow me over here a moment.” Malfoy led that to the very edge of the forest.
----------------------------------------------
Holding Malfoy lamp up high, Malfoy pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees.
----------------------------------------------
We might have ter put ter out of ter misery.” “And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds We first?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of Malfoy voice.
----------------------------------------------
There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.” “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.
----------------------------------------------
“All right, but I warn yeh, Malfoy’s a coward,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
A little way into The forest they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville ...
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with Fang.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed Neville as a joke.
----------------------------------------------
I’m sorry,Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but Harry’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.
----------------------------------------------
“Look — ” Harry murmured, holding out Harry arm to stop Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed.
----------------------------------------------
” Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang.
----------------------------------------------
Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging Harry goblet on the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Great Hall
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
I read about It in Hogwarts, A History.” It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of a rabbit, Harrythought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the Great Hall was now staring at a pointed wizard’s hat, Harry stared at a pointed wizard’s hat, too.
----------------------------------------------
Off you trot!” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron finally managed to find Harry and Ron way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had gotten used to this by now, but the mail had given Harry a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until about a hundred owls saw about a hundred owls owners, and dropping letters and packages onto about a hundred owls laps.
----------------------------------------------
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve never even touched one.” They left the Great Hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before They first class, but halfway across the entrance hall They found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Neville overheard Parvati Patil telling Harry friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
----------------------------------------------
Neville looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later the girls had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of the girls minds.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
“Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.” So the three of them followed Hagrid and Hagrid tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?” the Great Hall looked spectacular.
----------------------------------------------
“the library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving Harry one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full.
----------------------------------------------
the Great Hall was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Madam Pomfrey’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.
----------------------------------------------
I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.” Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Peeves
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give a fat little monk a second chance — ” “My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances a fat little monk deserves?
----------------------------------------------
“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years.
----------------------------------------------
“A poltergeist.” Percy raised Percy voice, “Peeves — show yourself.” A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
----------------------------------------------
“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean this!” barked Percy.
----------------------------------------------
Peeves stuck out Peeves tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head.
----------------------------------------------
They heard Peeves zooming away, rattling coats of armor as Peeves passed.
----------------------------------------------
“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again.
----------------------------------------------
Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met Nick when you were late for class.
----------------------------------------------
Nick would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!” Even worse than Peeves the Poltergeist, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.
----------------------------------------------
“In here.” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall pointed they into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
----------------------------------------------
“Out, Peeves!” Professor McGonagall barked.
----------------------------------------------
Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and Peeves swooped out cursing.
----------------------------------------------
It was Peeves.
----------------------------------------------
“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.” Peeves cackled.
----------------------------------------------
Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity voice, but Peeves eyes glittered wickedly.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s for your own good, you know.” “Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves — this was a big mistake.
----------------------------------------------
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!” Ducking under Peeves, they ran for they lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.
----------------------------------------------
“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying.
----------------------------------------------
“Quick, tell me.” “Say ‘please.’ ” “Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?” “Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.
----------------------------------------------
Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filchcursing in rage.
----------------------------------------------
“Maybe Peeves let Peeves in for a Halloween joke.” They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.
----------------------------------------------
...” ’s made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then ’s told them what ’s ’d seen and heard.
----------------------------------------------
It was a very dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on their.
----------------------------------------------
Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.
----------------------------------------------
“Peeves,” Harry said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has Baron own reasons for being invisible.” Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock.
----------------------------------------------
“My mistake, My mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie Peevsie little joke, sir.” “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Stay away from this place tonight.” “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Seamus
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before a pointed wizard’s hat declared him a Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
“My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!” “I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy — ” the ghost in the ruff began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
----------------------------------------------
“How did Harry get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus .
----------------------------------------------
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, them had noticed that a funny smell hung around Quirrell’s turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that Quirrell was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever Quirrell went.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
“Take Professor Snape up to the hospital wing,” Professor Snape spat at Seamus.
----------------------------------------------
“Cheer up,” said Ron, Seamus’s always taking points off Fred and George.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, Malfoy’d spent most of Malfoy childhood zooming around the countryside on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad caught Ron prodding Seamus’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.
----------------------------------------------
All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as Harry lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing).
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch Neville eye).
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather Harry and Seamus were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.
----------------------------------------------
Seamus got so impatient that himself prodded the desktop with himself wand and set fire to the desktop — Harry had to put the desktop out with Harry hat.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan.
----------------------------------------------
“Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.” “Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on Seamus sausages.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.
----------------------------------------------
“Did something happen to it when — Marcus Flint blocked Harry?” Seamus whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent Harry, and old chessmen didn’t trust Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------

Snape
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.” Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at Snape again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape didn’t dislike Harry — Professor Snape hated Harry —.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, Professor Snape paused at Harry’s name.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, yes,” Professor Snape said softly, “Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but warmth caught every word — like Professor Binns, Professor Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter!” said Professor Snape suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was still ignoring ’s quivering hand.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape, however, was not pleased.
----------------------------------------------
“Sit down,” Professor Snape snapped at Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape put them all into pairs and set pairs to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed Professor Snape horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
“Idiot boy!” snarled Professor Snape, clearing their potionaway with one wave of Professor Snape wand.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” Professor Snape whimpered as boils started to pop up all over Professor Snape nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Take Professor Snape up to the hospital wing,” Professor Snape spat at Seamus.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in Harry’s very first week — why did Professor Snape hate Professor Snape so much?
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
“But Professor Snape seemed to really hate me.” “Rubbish!” said Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
And did Hagrid know something about Snape that Snape didn’t want to tell Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had never been on a broomstick in Professor Snape life, because Professor Snape grandmother had never let Professor Snape near one.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Professor Snape was.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
----------------------------------------------
A barn owl brought Professor Snape a small package from Professor Snape grandmother.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape opened a small package from his grandmother excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
----------------------------------------------
“a small package from his grandmother’s the Remembrall!” Professor Snape explained.
----------------------------------------------
Look, you hold it tight like this and if this turns red — oh ...” Professor Snape face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “...
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as white as Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.
----------------------------------------------
Peering around a large stone griffin, however, “Percy!” saw not Percy but Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Why isn’t Percy down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” “Search me.” Quietly as possible, Quietly crept along the next corridor after Snape ’s fading footsteps.
----------------------------------------------
A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the whole room , closely followed by Snape, with Professor Quirrell bringing up the rear.
----------------------------------------------
Snape bent over even a troll.
----------------------------------------------
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look.
----------------------------------------------
It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.
----------------------------------------------
them were standing with them backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
Snape limped over.
----------------------------------------------
Snape hadn’t seen a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but Snape seemed to be looking for a reason to tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione off anyway.
----------------------------------------------
“Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Five points from Gryffindor.” “He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.
----------------------------------------------
Why should Harry be afraid of Snape?
----------------------------------------------
Getting up, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask Snape if Harry could have it.
----------------------------------------------
“Better you than Harry,” Ron, and Hermione said together, but Harryhad an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there?
----------------------------------------------
Snape and Filch were inside, alone.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was holding Snape robes above Snape knees.
----------------------------------------------
One of Snape legs was bloody and mangled.
----------------------------------------------
Filch was handing Snape bandages.
----------------------------------------------
“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying.
----------------------------------------------
“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER!Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as Snape dropped his robes above his knees quickly to hide Snape leg.
----------------------------------------------
OUT!” Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
I wouldn’t put anything past Snape.
----------------------------------------------
But what’s Snape after?
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry needed to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy to forget.
----------------------------------------------
“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” Ron grabbed his binoculars.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them.
----------------------------------------------
Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
Reaching Snape, Snape crouched down, pulled out Snape wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words.
----------------------------------------------
Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape ’s robes.
----------------------------------------------
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that Snape was on fire.
----------------------------------------------
A sudden yelp told Snape Snape had done Snape job.
----------------------------------------------
Scooping fire off Snape into a little jar in Snape pocket, Snape scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know what had happened.
----------------------------------------------
“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s top secret, that is.” “But Snape’s trying to steal That.” “Rubbish,” said Hagrid again.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, Snape’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did Snape just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.
----------------------------------------------
You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw Snape!” “I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly.
----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy was insultin’ Malfoy family.” “Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said Snape silkily.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let Hagrid slip, because how else were Ron, going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?
----------------------------------------------
He, Ron, and Hermione were sure Madam ’d be able to tell He, Ron, and Hermione , but He, Ron, and Hermione couldn’t risk Snape hearing what He, Ron, and Hermione were up to.
----------------------------------------------
Wherever Harry was, Filch must know a shortcut, because Harry soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to Harry horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section in the library?
----------------------------------------------
Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch they.” Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.
----------------------------------------------
Filch and Snape couldn’t see Harry, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if came much nearer they’d knock right into Harry — an Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Harry from being solid.
----------------------------------------------
panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, wanting to look at Harry but see no reflection again.
----------------------------------------------
What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?
----------------------------------------------
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.
----------------------------------------------
So what if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris can’t see you?
----------------------------------------------
What if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris walk into you?
----------------------------------------------
“ Filch’s refereeing?” Snape spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve just got to make sure We play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on We.” Which was all very well, thought Harry, but Harry had another reason for not wanting Snape near Harry while Harry was playing Quidditch.
----------------------------------------------
You look terrible.” Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
----------------------------------------------
“No wonder Snape’s after Snape’s!
----------------------------------------------
Anyone would want Snape’s.” “And no wonder we couldn’t find Nicolas Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is Ron?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d do with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t until Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m going to play,” Snape told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t know whether Harry was imagining it or not, but Harry seemed to keep running into Snape wherever Harry went.
----------------------------------------------
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t see how Harry could — yet Harry sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
----------------------------------------------
They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if Snape showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.” “The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door.
----------------------------------------------
“Even — blimey — Snape’s come to watch!” Harry’s heart did a somersault.
----------------------------------------------
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt Harry if Dumbledore gently was watching.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ronnoticed, too.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” Snape told Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Wonder how long Snape’s going to stay on Snape’s broom this time?
----------------------------------------------
What about you, Weasley?” Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because Weasley had hit a Bludger at Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said ” Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Snape’s obviously spotted some money on the ground!” said ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Up in the air, Snape turned on Snape broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past Snape, missing Snape by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, Harry arm raised in triumph, the Snitchclasped in the Snitch hand.
----------------------------------------------
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
----------------------------------------------
excellent ...” Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
He’d done Gryffindor in the lead, Harry’d shown Snape.
----------------------------------------------
And speaking of Snape .
----------------------------------------------
Snape, sneaking into the forbidden forest while everyone else was at dinner — what was going on?
----------------------------------------------
Gliding silently over the castle Harry saw Snape enter the forbidden forest at a run.
----------------------------------------------
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but Harry wasn’t alone.
----------------------------------------------
d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus ...” “Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, Snape voice icy.
----------------------------------------------
Snape interrupted Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet?” “B-b-but Severus, I — ” “You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking a step toward Snape.
----------------------------------------------
An owl steadied An owl in time to hear Snape say, “ — your little bit of hocus-pocus.
----------------------------------------------
I’m waiting.” “B-b-but I d-d-don’t — ” “Very well,” Snape cut in.
----------------------------------------------
“Well have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.” Snape threw Snape cloak over Snape head and strode out of a shadowy clearing.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says Snape’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!
----------------------------------------------
“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help Snape’s get Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
Snapewas sweeping about in Snape usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Sorcerer’s Stone was still safe.
----------------------------------------------
Oh yeah, Snape.” “Snape?” “Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh?
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
If Snape had been in on protecting the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape had been in on protecting the Stone must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded Snape had been in on protecting the Stone.
----------------------------------------------
Snape probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.
----------------------------------------------
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
----------------------------------------------
All the same, Harry’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in Snape step Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.
----------------------------------------------
“Maybe Snapefound out how to get past Snape without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding asking Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Snapeonly got to say Snape doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that Snape was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think the troll’ll believe, Snape or we?
----------------------------------------------
It’s not exactly a secret we hate Snape, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it up to get Dumbledore sacked.
----------------------------------------------
Filch wouldn’t help we if Filch life depended on his life , Filch’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, Filch’ll think.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ...
----------------------------------------------
and all this time we thought “Snape just wanted to get rich.
----------------------------------------------
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while their tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of Voldemort certainly scared The idea of Voldemort, but The idea of Voldemort didn’t keep visiting The idea of Voldemort in dreams, and The idea of Voldemort were so busy with The idea of Voldemort studying The idea of Voldemort didn’t have much time to fret about what “Snape or anyone else might be up to.
----------------------------------------------
Anyway, we’ve never had any proof “Snape found out how to get past Fluffy.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape nearly had “Snape leg ripped off once, “Snape’s not going to try it again in a hurry.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s found out everything Snape’s needs, and now Snape’s got Dumbledoreout of the way.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was standing there.
----------------------------------------------
“Good afternoon,” Snape said smoothly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron stared at Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” Snape said, with an odd, twisted smile.
----------------------------------------------
“You want to be more careful,” said Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“One of we has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staffroom and follow Snape — if Snape — leaves the staffroom.
----------------------------------------------
’ ” “Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but Hermione agreed to go and watch out for Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get Snape, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” “Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
The other two stared at Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was pale and Snape eyes were glittering.
----------------------------------------------
“After what Professor McGonagall and Snape have said?
----------------------------------------------
If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back!
----------------------------------------------
Haven’t you heard what it was like when Snape was trying to take over?
----------------------------------------------
Snape’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts!
----------------------------------------------
“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.” Seeing the door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of “Brilliant, Harry!” what was facing “Brilliant, Harry!”.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape must have left it there.” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, here goes ...” Snape put Hagrid’s flute to Snape lips and blew.
----------------------------------------------
“ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and Hermione whipped out Hermione wand, waved her wand, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames Hermione had used on Snape at the plant.
----------------------------------------------
I make my move and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” “But — of course“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” “Ron — ” “Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the Stone!” There was no alternative.
----------------------------------------------
“What do you reckonhe’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured The chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” them had reached another door.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for Dumbledore, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at Harry scar.
----------------------------------------------
There was already someone there — but it wasn’t Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — Snape — ” “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and Quirrell wasn’t Quirrell usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
----------------------------------------------
“But Snape tried to kill me!” “No, no, no.
----------------------------------------------
Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as Your friend Miss Granger rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
I’d have managed that broom before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.” Snape Snape was trying to save me?” “Of course,” said Quirrell coolly.
----------------------------------------------
“Why do you think Snape wanted to referee your next match?
----------------------------------------------
Snape was trying to make sure I didn’t do that broom again.
----------------------------------------------
Snape needn’t have bothered.
----------------------------------------------
All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, Snape did make Snape unpopular .
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for everyone else was , Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did the troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape ’s leg off properly.
----------------------------------------------
“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” Snape blurted out.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got.
----------------------------------------------
Snape suspected me all along.
----------------------------------------------
Tried to frighten me — as though Snape could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side.
----------------------------------------------
“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” “Oh, Snape does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know?
----------------------------------------------
But Snape never wanted you dead.” “But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was threatening you.
----------------------------------------------
“Sometimes,” Snape said, “I find it hard to follow “Master’s instructions — Snape is a great wizard and I am weak — ” “You mean Snape was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly.
----------------------------------------------
“I met Snape when I traveled around the world.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Is that true?” “Well, Professor Snape did rather detest each other.
----------------------------------------------
And then, Dumbledore did something Snape could never forgive.” “What?” “Snape saved Snape life.” “What?” “Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in DumbledoreHarry’s debt.
----------------------------------------------
I do believe Professor Snape worked so hard to protect you this year because Professor Snape felt that would make Professor Snape and your father even.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape could go back to hating Dumbledore’s memory in peace.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile.
----------------------------------------------
Snape caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape ’s feelings toward Snape hadn’t changed one jot.
----------------------------------------------

*************************************************
Filch
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
----------------------------------------------
Nick would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!” Even worse than Peeves the Poltergeist, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch found Harry and Ron trying to force Harry and Ron way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch wouldn’t believe Harry and Ron were lost, was sure Harry and Ron were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock Harry and Ron in the dungeons when Harry and Ron were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust- colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch’s.
----------------------------------------------
Break a rule in front of She, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had spent all evening giving Ron advice such as “If Ron tries to curse you, you’d better dodge he tries to curse you, because I can’t remember how to block he tries to curse you.” There was a very good chance he tries to curse you were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt Harry was pushing Harry luck, breaking another school rule today.
----------------------------------------------
“You are not.” “D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?
----------------------------------------------
If Filch finds all three of us I’ll tell Filch the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.” “You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly.
----------------------------------------------
At every turn Harryexpected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but them all were lucky.
----------------------------------------------
“Sniff around, my sweet, “Sniff around, my sweet might be lurking in a corner.” It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris?”.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady’s robes had barely whipped round a corner when Neville’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
the others could hear Filch getting nearer.
----------------------------------------------
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along a hidden passageway and came out near they Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was never going to meet you Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped someone off.” Harry thought Harry was probably right, but Harry wasn’t going to tell Harry that.
----------------------------------------------
Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity voice, but Peeves eyes glittered wickedly.
----------------------------------------------
This is the end!” they could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as Filch could toward the Fat Lady’s shouts.
----------------------------------------------
“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying.
----------------------------------------------
Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, Harry’d take Filch.
----------------------------------------------
Filch must have hurried off to look for They somewhere else, because They didn’t see Filch anywhere, but they did hardly cared — all they did wanted to do was put as much space as possible between they did and that monster.
----------------------------------------------
Snape and Filch were inside, alone.
----------------------------------------------
Filch was handing Snape bandages.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through Harry, and Harryslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, One bookFilch’s shrieks still ringing in Harry ears.
----------------------------------------------
Wherever Harry was, Filch must know a shortcut, because Harry soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to Harry horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section in the library?
----------------------------------------------
Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch they.” Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.
----------------------------------------------
Filch and Snape couldn’t see Harry, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if came much nearer they’d knock right into Harry — an Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Harry from being solid.
----------------------------------------------
panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, wanting to look at Harry but see no reflection again.
----------------------------------------------
“This isn’t safe — Mrs. Norris might have gone for Filch, I bet Mrs. Norris heard us.
----------------------------------------------
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.
----------------------------------------------
So what if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris can’t see you?
----------------------------------------------
What if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris walk into you?
----------------------------------------------
She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that Filch had hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
----------------------------------------------
Filch’s refereeing this time, and Filch’s’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” George Weasley really did fall off George Weasley broom at these words.
----------------------------------------------
“ Filch’s refereeing?” Snape spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
----------------------------------------------
“Filch’s George Weasley ever refereed a Quidditch match?
----------------------------------------------
As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.
----------------------------------------------
Filch took Things down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor, where Things sat and waited without saying a word to each other.
----------------------------------------------
Filch wouldn’t help we if Filch life depended on his life , Filch’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, Filch’ll think.
----------------------------------------------
Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading Malfoy had gotten a detention, too outside.
----------------------------------------------
It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.
----------------------------------------------
“Is that you, Filch?
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid relief must have showed in Hagrid face, because Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?
----------------------------------------------
“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, Filch voice cracking with glee.
----------------------------------------------
All right, Harry, Hermione?” “I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” , Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” ’re here to be punished, after all.” “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
----------------------------------------------
Bin lecturin done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.” “I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, he lamp bobbing away in the darkness.
----------------------------------------------
“We’d better put cloak on here, and make sure cloak covers all three of We — if Filch spots one of We feet wandering along on its own — ” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the common room.
----------------------------------------------
In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on their.
----------------------------------------------
“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.” Harry had a sudden idea.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Madam Hooch
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Stick out your right hand over his broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ” “UP!” everyone shouted.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount them brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting them grips.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been doing Malfoy wrong for years.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
On my whistle — three — two — ” But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.
----------------------------------------------
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as white as Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
“Broken wrist,” Harry heard Madam Hooch mutter.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, boy — it’s all right, up you get.” Madam Hooch turned to the rest of the class.
----------------------------------------------
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around his.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” Harry ignored Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was refereeing.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, Madam Hooch broom in Madam Hooch hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” Madam Hooch said, once they were all gathered around Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed that Madam Hooch seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on Madam Hooch silver whistle.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to — Marcus Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Professor Snape
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape didn’t dislike Harry — Professor Snape hated Harry —.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, Professor Snape paused at Harry’s name.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, yes,” Professor Snape said softly, “Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but warmth caught every word — like Professor Binns, Professor Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter!” said Professor Snape suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was still ignoring ’s quivering hand.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape, however, was not pleased.
----------------------------------------------
“Sit down,” Professor Snape snapped at Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape put them all into pairs and set pairs to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed Professor Snape horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
“Idiot boy!” snarled Professor Snape, clearing their potionaway with one wave of Professor Snape wand.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” Professor Snape whimpered as boils started to pop up all over Professor Snape nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Take Professor Snape up to the hospital wing,” Professor Snape spat at Seamus.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in Harry’s very first week — why did Professor Snape hate Professor Snape so much?
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
“But Professor Snape seemed to really hate me.” “Rubbish!” said Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had never been on a broomstick in Professor Snape life, because Professor Snape grandmother had never let Professor Snape near one.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Professor Snape was.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
----------------------------------------------
A barn owl brought Professor Snape a small package from Professor Snape grandmother.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape opened a small package from his grandmother excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
----------------------------------------------
“a small package from his grandmother’s the Remembrall!” Professor Snape explained.
----------------------------------------------
Look, you hold it tight like this and if this turns red — oh ...” Professor Snape face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “...
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as white as Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Is that true?” “Well, Professor Snape did rather detest each other.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in DumbledoreHarry’s debt.
----------------------------------------------
I do believe Professor Snape worked so hard to protect you this year because Professor Snape felt that would make Professor Snape and your father even.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape could go back to hating Dumbledore’s memory in peace.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Fang
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Then Hagrid voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry pulled the door open.
----------------------------------------------
“Back, Fang.” Harry let Back, Fang.” in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.
----------------------------------------------
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking Ron ears.
----------------------------------------------
Like Hagrid , Fang was clearly not as fierce as Fang looked.
----------------------------------------------
Fang rested Fang head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over Fang robes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at Fang heel.
----------------------------------------------
Fang was carrying Fang large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over Fang shoulder.
----------------------------------------------
“Abou’ time,” Fang said.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.” “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.
----------------------------------------------
“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other.
----------------------------------------------
A little way into The forest they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with Fang.
----------------------------------------------
Right, ’m’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with Neville an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot.
----------------------------------------------
I’m sorry,Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but Harry’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed.
----------------------------------------------
” Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Fat Lady
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the portrait hole .
----------------------------------------------
Hermionehad turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady the Fat Lady to get back inside and found Hermione facing an empty painting.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
“Now what am I going to do?” the Fat Lady asked shrilly.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m coming with the Fat Lady,” the Fat Lady said.
----------------------------------------------
The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but Pig won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “How’s your arm?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow Harry as quickly as possible; “Sniff around, my sweet scurried silently toward the door, away from the Fat Lady’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady’s robes had barely whipped round a corner when Neville’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
This is the end!” they could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as Filch could toward the Fat Lady’s shouts.
----------------------------------------------
they did didn’t stop running until they did reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.
----------------------------------------------
“Where on earth have you all been?” the Fat Lady asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
----------------------------------------------
not the floorthe Fat Lady’sobviously guarding something.” Hermione stood up, glaring at them.
----------------------------------------------
we hadn’t had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Oliver Wood
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood was carrying a large wooden crate under Oliver Wood arm.
----------------------------------------------
Harry landed next to Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“Very nice,” said Wood, Oliver Wood eyes glinting.
----------------------------------------------
“Right,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
Three of them are called Chasers.” “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Oliver Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.
----------------------------------------------
“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?” “What’s basketball?” said Oliver Wood curiously.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll show you now,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“Very good,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or The Bludgers — ” “ — unless they crack my head open.” “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of the Bludgers.” Oliver Wood reached into a large wooden crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
----------------------------------------------
“This,” said Oliver Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and This’s the most important ball of the lot.
----------------------------------------------
Let’s try you out with a few of these.” Harry pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of Harry pocket and a few minutes later, Harry and Harry were up in the air, Oliver Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as Harry could in every direction for Harry to catch.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Oliver Wood was delighted.
----------------------------------------------
“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Oliver Wood happily as Oliver Wood trudged back up to the castle.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Quaffle
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get the Quaffle through one of the hoops to score a goal.
----------------------------------------------
Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops.
----------------------------------------------
Follow me?” “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put the Quaffle through the hoops to score,” Harry recited.
----------------------------------------------
“And they play with the Quaffle.
----------------------------------------------
“These two are the Bludgers.” He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the Quaffle.
----------------------------------------------
So — think you’ve got all that?” “Three The Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep The Bludgers away from the Beaters ,” Harry reeled off.
----------------------------------------------
And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or The Bludgers — ” “ — unless they crack my head open.” “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of the Bludgers.” Oliver Wood reached into a large wooden crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
----------------------------------------------
Compared with the Quaffle and The Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.
----------------------------------------------
You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Golden Snitch wins the Golden Snitch team an extra hundred and fifty points, so the Golden Snitch nearly always win.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch ?” A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over Adrian Pucey shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed Adrian Pucey left ear.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Higgs — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” the Slytherins were cheering.
----------------------------------------------
— Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.

Fluffy
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“How do you know about Fluffy?” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
“ Fluffy ?” “Yeah — bought off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent to Dumbledore to guard the — ” “Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ go shoutin’ about shoutin, what’s the matter with yeh?” “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” “SHHHH!” said Hagrid again.
----------------------------------------------
“We were wondering if you could tell We what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy.” Hagrid frowned at Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell We, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore borrowed Fluffy from Dumbledore ...
----------------------------------------------
Snape probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously.
----------------------------------------------
I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit.
----------------------------------------------
“If Quirrell’s told Ron how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy.
----------------------------------------------
Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.
----------------------------------------------
Anyway, we’ve never had any proof “Snape found out how to get past Fluffy.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy .
----------------------------------------------
So I told it ter, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy.
----------------------------------------------
...” “And did it ter — did it ter seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to keep it ter voice calm.
----------------------------------------------
So I told it ter, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm yeh down, jus’ play yeh a bit o’ music an’ yeh’ll go straight off ter sleep — ” Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk.
----------------------------------------------
No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, Professor McGonagall lost Professor McGonagall temper.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pocketed the flute Hagrid to use on Fluffy — Harry didn’t feel much like singing.
----------------------------------------------
their couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snapemight even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.” Seeing the door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of “Brilliant, Harry!” what was facing “Brilliant, Harry!”.
----------------------------------------------
Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy!
----------------------------------------------

Norbert
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell, however, must have been braver than THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell’d thought.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve decided to call The baby dragon Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at The baby dragon with misty eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Norbert!
----------------------------------------------
Norbert!
----------------------------------------------
We could send Norbert to Norbert.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had been down at Hagrid hut, helping Ron feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.
----------------------------------------------
“It shouldn’t be too difficult — I think it’s still dark big enough to cover two of We and Norbert.” It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him.
----------------------------------------------
Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
The cut looked as if Norbert’s fangs were poisonous.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” Ron, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.
----------------------------------------------
“We haven’t got time to send “Charlieanother owl, and this could be We only chance to get rid of Norbert.
----------------------------------------------
“I won’t let you in,” Norbert puffed.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” When Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky letter, Norbert eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg.
----------------------------------------------
It’s all right, Norbert only got my boot — jus’ playin’ — Norbert’s only a baby, after all.” only a baby banged only a baby tail on the wall, making the windows rattle.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for Hagrid to say good-bye to Norbert if Ron, and Hermione hadn’t been so worried about what Ron, and Hermione had to do.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Hagrid in a muffled voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Midnight ticked nearer as Harry and Hermione heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.
----------------------------------------------
Norbert’s at a tricky friends were a cheery lot.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie’s friends showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so Charlie’s friends could suspend Norbert between Charlie’s friends.
----------------------------------------------
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked Harry and Hermione very much.
----------------------------------------------
At last, Norbert was going ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione slipped back down the spiral staircase, Harry and Hermione hearts as light as Harry and Hermione hands, now that Norbert was off Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, well, well,” Norbert whispered, “we are in trouble.” They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.
----------------------------------------------
Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak might as well be packing Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak bags already.
----------------------------------------------
a drag — ” Harry looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as a drag — ” Harry towered over the three of them.
----------------------------------------------
You know that night you won Norbert?
----------------------------------------------
If the dragons met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough ...
----------------------------------------------

*************************************************
Ronan
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
Ronan had a deep, sorrowful voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Were you going to shoot me?” “Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting Ronan crossbow.
----------------------------------------------
An’ this is Ronan, you two.
----------------------------------------------
“Good evening,” said Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed.
----------------------------------------------
“Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?” Ronan didn’t answer immediately.
----------------------------------------------
Ronan stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.
----------------------------------------------
“Always the innocent are the first victims,” Ronan said.
----------------------------------------------
“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, Ronan?
----------------------------------------------
Anythin’ unusual?” Mars Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched Ronan impatiently.
----------------------------------------------
“So Ronan haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?” Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer.
----------------------------------------------
At last, Ronan said, “The forest hides many secrets.” A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagridraise Hagrid bow again, but Hagrid was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in here lately?
----------------------------------------------
There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
We’ll be off, then.” Harry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, staring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked Harry and Hermione view.
----------------------------------------------
A centaur was standing over Harry, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; Harry had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
----------------------------------------------
Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, Ronan and Bane flanks heaving and sweaty.
----------------------------------------------
Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?” Ronan pawed the ground nervously.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m sure Firenze thought Ronan was acting for the best,” Ronan said in Ronan gloomy voice.
----------------------------------------------
I set myself against what is lurking in The forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside myself if I must.” And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best Harry could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind Ronan and Bane.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Bane
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
Bane looked skyward.
----------------------------------------------
Mars Mars is bright tonight,” Bane said simply.
----------------------------------------------
We’ll be off, then.” Harry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, staring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked Harry and Hermione view.
----------------------------------------------
A centaur was standing over Harry, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; Harry had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
----------------------------------------------
Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, Ronan and Bane flanks heaving and sweaty.
----------------------------------------------
“Firenze!” Bane thundered.
----------------------------------------------
The quicker the Potter boy leaves The forest, the better.” “What have you been telling the Potter boy?” growled Bane.
----------------------------------------------
Bane kicked Bane back legs in anger.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane.
----------------------------------------------
I set myself against what is lurking in The forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside myself if I must.” And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best Harry could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind Ronan and Bane.
----------------------------------------------
“Why’s Bane so angry?” Harry asked.
----------------------------------------------
Bane was furious ...
----------------------------------------------
Bane was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.
----------------------------------------------
Well, I suppose Bane be happy.” Hermione looked very frightened, but Hermione had a word of comfort.
----------------------------------------------
Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop Bane.
----------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------


*************************************************
Lord Voldemort
*************************************************

----------------------------------------------
Tried to frighten me — as though Snape could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was.
----------------------------------------------
Since then, I have served Lord Voldemort faithfully, although I have let Lord Voldemort down many times.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
“Lord Voldemort does not forgive mistakes easily.
----------------------------------------------
When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, Lord Voldemort was most displeased.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort punished me .
----------------------------------------------
decided Lord Voldemort would have to keep a closer watch on me.
----------------------------------------------
Now give me the Stone, unless you want your mother to have died in vain.” “NEVER!” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist.
----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
“Then kill Harry, fool, and be done!” screeched Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort said that Lord Voldemort only killed my mother because my mother tried to stop Lord Voldemort from killing me.
----------------------------------------------
But why would Lord Voldemort want to kill me in the first place?” Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
----------------------------------------------
If there is one thing Lord Voldemort cannot understand, it is love.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort didn’t realize that love as powerful as my mother ’s for you leaves that love as powerful as your mother’s for you own mark.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing Quirrell soul with Lord Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
the mirror’s almost like “D’you thought I had the right to face Lord Voldemort if I could.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, this is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, Yeh’d have found out even if you hadn’t told Yeh.” “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
