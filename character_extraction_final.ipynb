      "“I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.\n",

      "You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment The blood of a unicorn touches your lips.” Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\n",

      "There was somethin’ goin’ on that night Don hadn’t counted on — / dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped Don, all right.” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in Hagrid eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.\n",

      "It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for wand when wand brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” Harry swallowed.\n",

      "his eyes felt as though Harry was sitting on some sort of plant.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” Harry’s ear rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "Quirrell raised Quirrell hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — “AAAARGH!” Quirrell rolled off Quirrell, Quirrell face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch Harry bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep his in enough pain to stop his from doing a curse.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled Harry back by the scruff of Harry neck.\n",

      "the troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up even a troll nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in Harry hand when Harry’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.\n",
