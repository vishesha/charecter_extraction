Privet Drive
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
The cat was staring down Privet Drive as though The cat were waiting for something.
----------------------------------------------
By the time The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor was allowed out of The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley’s had already broken Dudley’s new video camera, crashed Dudley’s remote control airplane, and, first time out on Dudley’s racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as old Mrs. Figg crossed Privet Drive on old Mrs. Figg crutches.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, Mr. Dursley watched a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive in Mr. Dursley mirror.
----------------------------------------------
the cat on the wall outside was sitting as still as a statue, the cat on the wall outside eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore clicked the silver Put- Outer once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and Albus Dumbledore could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
----------------------------------------------
Nothing like A man had ever been seen on Privet Drive.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley gave Mr. Dursley a little shake and put a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive out of Mr. Dursley mind.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, Privet Drive — ’ ” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald- green ink.
----------------------------------------------
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.
----------------------------------------------
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Mr. Dursley
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley cleared Mr. Dursley throat nervously.
----------------------------------------------
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up Mr. Dursleybriefcase, pecked Mr. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing Dudley cereal at the walls.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley couldn’t see how Mr. Dursley and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — Mr. Dursley yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect he and Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when Mr. Dursley thought Mr. Dursley’d stretch Mr. Dursley legs and walk across the road to buy Mr. Dursley a bun from the bakery.
----------------------------------------------
But I can promise a wet night tonight.” Mr. Dursley sat frozen in Mr. Dursley armchair.
----------------------------------------------
Instead Mr. Dursley said, as casually as Mr. Dursley could, “Owls son — Mr. Dursley’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t Mr. Dursley?” “I suppose so,” said Mr. Dursley stiffly.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley drove toward town Mr. Dursley thought of nothing except a large order of drills Mr. Dursley was hoping to get that day.
----------------------------------------------
When Mr. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley drummed Mr. Dursley fingers on the steering wheel and Mr. Dursley eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but the Potters had a small son, too had never even seen a small son.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing Mr. Dursley saw — and it didn’t improve Mr. Dursley mood — was the tabby cat Mr. Dursley’d spotted that morning.
----------------------------------------------
This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and Mr. Dursley couldn’t see a single collecting tin.
----------------------------------------------
It was on Mr. Dursley way back past five different people, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that Mr. Dursley caught a few words of what five different people were saying.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was sure the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning was the same one; the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning had the same markings around the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley crowd.” Mr. Dursley sipped Mr. Dursley tea through pursed lips.
----------------------------------------------
What could Mr. Dursley have been thinking of?
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as Mr. Dursley spent so much of Mr. Dursley time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; people pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.
----------------------------------------------
But then The nerve of him struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something ...
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but Mr. Dursley hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mr. Dursley pretended Mr. Dursley didn’t have a sister, because Mr. Dursley sister and Mr. Dursley good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley wondered whether Mr. Dursley dared tell Mr. Dursley Mr. Dursley’d heard “Harry.” Mr. Dursley decided Mr. Dursley didn’t dare.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.
----------------------------------------------
It was on the corner of the street that Mr. Dursley noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map.
----------------------------------------------
Was Mr. Dursley imagining things?
----------------------------------------------
It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the tiny old man was wearing a violet cloak.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people!
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of They weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than man was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!
----------------------------------------------
if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, Mr. Dursley didn’t think Mr. Dursley could bear it.
----------------------------------------------
“Why?” “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, Mr. Dursley watched a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive in Mr. Dursley mirror.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley told Mr. Dursley over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with Mr. Dursley daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”).
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley eyed five different people angrily as Mr. Dursley passed.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley gave Mr. Dursley a little shake and put a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive out of Mr. Dursley mind.
----------------------------------------------
He’d have to say something to Mr. Dursley.
----------------------------------------------
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of Mr. Dursley mind by something else.
----------------------------------------------
Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!” And the tiny old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley looked back at the whisperers as if Mr. Dursley wanted to say something to them, but thought better of the whisperers.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although Mr. Dursley did have a very large mustache.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley put the receiver back down and stroked Mr. Dursley mustache, thinking ...
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley had everything Mr. Dursley wanted, but Mr. Dursley also had a secret, and Mr. Dursley greatest fear was that somebody would discover .
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.
----------------------------------------------
and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today ...” “So?” snapped Mr. Dursley.
----------------------------------------------
While Mr. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.
----------------------------------------------
For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what Mr. Dursleyhad seen — then Mr. Dursley jerked Mr. Dursley head around to look again.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley wondered.
----------------------------------------------
their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls held no sign at a large blond boylived in the house, too.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was still determined not to mention anything to Mr. Dursley wife.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley didn’t think Mr. Dursley could bear if anyone found out about the Potters.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley hummed as Mr. Dursley picked out Mr. Dursley most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as Mrs. Dursley wrestled a screaming Dudley into Mr. Dursley high chair.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping Mr. Dursley was imagining things, which Mr. Dursley had never hoped before, because Mr. Dursley didn’t approve of imagination.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Dudley
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but Dudley’s couldn’t often catch Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley’s on the moth-eaten sofa.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering...
----------------------------------------------
While Dudley’s drove, Uncle Vernon complained to His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley’s and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on the animals favorite hobby of hitting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with Dudley’s, but before His aunt and uncle’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
When Dudley turned Dudley back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in Harry trousers.
----------------------------------------------
Atta boy, Dudley!” was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when His Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
----------------------------------------------
the animals ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley’s had a tantrum because Dudley’s knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought Dudley’s another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
----------------------------------------------
a small son was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; the Potters didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
----------------------------------------------
I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle in somehow.” Harry was strongly reminded of even Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
“The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then Dudley’s ran, before Dudley’s could work out what Dudley’s’d said.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley’s won, so Harry, Harry glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on Harry stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
----------------------------------------------
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
----------------------------------------------
“Ate a funny whelk ...” “Dad!” said Dudley’s suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s was hungry, Dudley’s’d missed five television programs Dudley’s’d wanted to see, and Dudley’s’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on Dudley’s computer.
----------------------------------------------
“Thirty-six,” Dudley’s said, looking up at Dudley’s mother and father.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
----------------------------------------------
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up Mr. Dursleybriefcase, pecked Mr. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing Dudley cereal at the walls.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s face fell.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had always been last to be chosen, not because Harry was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s had been accepted at Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings.
----------------------------------------------
It was even worth being with Dudley’s and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, Dudley’s cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.
----------------------------------------------
What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley’s were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, Piers and Dudley had leapt back with howls of horror.
----------------------------------------------
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry to do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t speak to Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let Dudley’s spoil your special day!” his mother cried, flinging his mother arms around Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
his money’s can’t take Atta boy, Dudley!”.” his money’s jerked his money’s head in Harry’s direction.
----------------------------------------------
t-t-to come!” Dudley’syelled between huge, pretend sobs.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s squeaked and ran to hide behind Dudley’s mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s — go — just go.” Harry walked round and round Harry new room.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find out how to curse even Dudley.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Do it again,” Dudley’s ordered.
----------------------------------------------
As far as Harry had seen, the largest snake in the place hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at Piers and Dudley heels as the largest snake in the place passed, but by the time Piers and Dudley were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley’s was telling Piers and Dudley how the largest snake in the place had nearly bitten off Dudley’s leg, while Piers was swearing the largest snake in the place had tried to squeeze Dudley’s to death.
----------------------------------------------
In fact, Dudley’s wasn’t really crying — it had been years since Dudley’s’d really cried — but Dudley’s knew that if Dudley’s screwed up Dudley’s face and wailed, Dudley’s would give Dudley’s anything Dudley’s wanted.
----------------------------------------------
The lighted dial of Dudley’s’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the moth-eaten sofa on Dudley’s fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
Once, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair so short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had laughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was already laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped glasses.
----------------------------------------------
That evening, Dudley’s paraded around the living room for the family in Dudley’s brand-new uniform.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia heard Dudley’s banging things with Dudley’s Smelting stick all the way down the hall.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything Dudley’s gives you, Dudley’s.” A giant of a man chuckled darkly.
----------------------------------------------
After all, Harry’d never had any money in Harry life until a month ago, and Harry told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
----------------------------------------------
Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” Dudley’s passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry Dudley’s had never tasted anything so wonderful, but Dudley’s still couldn’t take His eyes off A giant of a man.
----------------------------------------------
“Make it move,” Dudley’s whined at Dudley’s father.
----------------------------------------------
“Out of the way, you,” Dudley’s said, punching Harry in the ribs.
----------------------------------------------
He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown Dudley’s tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and Dudley’s still didn’t have Dudley’s room back.
----------------------------------------------
Instead Mr. Dursley said, as casually as Mr. Dursley could, “Owls son — Mr. Dursley’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t Mr. Dursley?” “I suppose so,” said Mr. Dursley stiffly.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’swasn’t used to being ignored.
----------------------------------------------
“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” Dudley’s told Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley’s had punched Harry on the nose.
----------------------------------------------
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to A tiny man in a violet top hat once while out shopping with His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what Harry wanted before they could hurry Harry away, they bought Harry a cheap lemon ice pop.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on Dudley’s thick, fat head.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Mrs. Figg’s new uniform.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s always sp- spoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with Dudley’s .
----------------------------------------------
“I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley told Mr. Dursley over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with Mr. Dursley daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”).
----------------------------------------------
Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” The woman held up a letter so Dudley and Harry could read the green ink address: Mr. H.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s’s mouth fell open in horror, but his money’s heart gave a leap.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down Dudley bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley’s turned the table over.
----------------------------------------------
One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was special, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as Mrs. Dursley opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking It as they watched a gorilla scratching It head who looked remarkably like Dudley’s, except that it wasn’t blond.
----------------------------------------------
When His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and Dudley arms over Aunt Petunia and Dudley faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” Dudley said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake.
----------------------------------------------
Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley’s was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, Dudley’s was the leader.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Harry ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.
----------------------------------------------
The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley’s had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s’s first-ever television set, which Dudley’s’d put Dudley’s foot through when Dudley’s favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley’shad swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley’shad sat on it.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s gave Dudley’s father a sharp tap on the head with Dudley’s Smelting stick.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that Harry was holding more money than he’d had in Harry whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s stood with Dudley’s nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.
----------------------------------------------
“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and Uncle Vernon took both Harryand Dudley’s by the scruffs of both necks and threw both into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind both.
----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s’s second bedroom.” “Why?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
a scrawny boy was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley’shit their.
----------------------------------------------
Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these.
----------------------------------------------
Next morning, however, Dudley’s had gotten up to find his hair exactly as his hair had been before His Aunt Petunia had sheared his hair off.
----------------------------------------------
Exactly why Dudley’s wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley’s was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s quickly found the largest snake in the place.
----------------------------------------------
By the time The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor was allowed out of The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley’s had already broken Dudley’s new video camera, crashed Dudley’s remote control airplane, and, first time out on Dudley’s racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as old Mrs. Figg crossed Privet Drive on old Mrs. Figg crutches.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’sand Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.
----------------------------------------------
Nobody said a thing while A giant of a man was working, but as A giant of a man slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley’sfidgeted a little.
----------------------------------------------
Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, Dudley’s said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” A giant of a man took a gulp of tea and wiped Dudley’s mouth with the back of Dudley’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made Harry sick.
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing, nothing ...” Dudley’s birthday — how could ” Dudley’s birthday have forgotten?
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Harry had just finished when the owner of a gloomy- looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city came over to Dudley and Harry table.
----------------------------------------------
If Him’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick Him around like a football?
----------------------------------------------
Oh my goodness — Vernon!” They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley’s were still in the room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry cleared Harry throat to let them know Harry was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.
----------------------------------------------
COME AND LOOK AT the largest snake in the placeYOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” Dudley’s came waddling toward them as fast as Dudley’s could.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s thought this was very funny.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit Dudley’s round the head for holding they up while Dudley’s tried to pack Dudley’s television, VCR, and computer in Dudley’s sports bag.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------
Another time, His Aunt Petunia had been trying to force His Aunt Petunia into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls).
----------------------------------------------
’Atta boy, Dudley’s!” Atta boy, Dudley!” ruffled his money’s hair.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t think I can be a wizard.” To Dudley surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its beady eyes to the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s two less than last year.” “Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.” “All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley’s, going red in His face.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked even smaller and skinnier than Harry really was because all Harry had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley’s was about four times bigger than Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley hummed as Mr. Dursley picked out Mr. Dursley most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as Mrs. Dursley wrestled a screaming Dudley into Mr. Dursley high chair.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
House
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“And come back and find The whole house smelled of cabbage in ruins?” His Aunt Petunia snarled.
----------------------------------------------
After what seemed like hours their reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns was head of Gryffindor House, but Professor Binns hadn’t stopped Professor Binns from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
----------------------------------------------
The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made Harry look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House.
----------------------------------------------
“My old House, you know.” “Move along now,” said a sharp voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest.
----------------------------------------------
“But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about — ” “ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth.
----------------------------------------------
D’you think D’you’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup?
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycomplained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with Malfoy narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.
----------------------------------------------
“Just come round my house this summer.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and ’s going to be as long as your house.
----------------------------------------------
Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on Harry, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
“I won’t blow up The whole house smelled of cabbage,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.
----------------------------------------------
The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
— with a person called — came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew Hagrid nose with a sound like a foghorn.
----------------------------------------------
“D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave Hagrid anything?” “But if their house was destroyed — ” “their didntheir keep their gold in their house, boy!
----------------------------------------------
You don’t think they’re watching the house?” “Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside Hagrid house; Hagrid trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and Hagrid was shelling peas into a large bowl.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.
----------------------------------------------
for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.” The din was deafening.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?
----------------------------------------------
I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.
----------------------------------------------
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where Harry could see a tiny ray of hope.
----------------------------------------------
the Great Hall was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Madam Pomfrey’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got Young Sirius Black, sir.” “No problems, were there?” “No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got sir — houseout all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around.
----------------------------------------------
the reptile house was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls.
----------------------------------------------
At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the House points the next day thought there ’d been a mistake.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree.
----------------------------------------------
House House has House own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards.
----------------------------------------------
All my family are dead — let me have another look — ” “You had this mirror to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.” “You’re only holding the House Cup, whatFilch’sinteresting about that?
----------------------------------------------
The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls held no sign at a large blond boylived in the house, too.
----------------------------------------------
If they won they next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Mirror
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
you go ...” “I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
----------------------------------------------
“the Mirror of Erised is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrellmurmured, tapping Quirrell way around the frame.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think this mirror shows the future?” “How can this mirror?
----------------------------------------------
I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
If A woman standing right behind his reflection was really there, Harry’d touch A woman standing right behind his reflection, their reflections were so close together, but Harry felt only air — A woman standing right behind his reflection and the others existed only in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
...” Quirrell came back out from behind the Mirror of Erised and stared hungrily into the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the Mirror of Erised to look at the back.
----------------------------------------------
Harrymust have walked straight past Harry, so desperate to get to the mirror Harry hadn’t noticed Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t think it was an accident “D’you let me find out how the mirror worked.
----------------------------------------------
“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.” “I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
...” “I can only see you.” “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, Harry couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ronin Harry paisley pajamas.
----------------------------------------------
If you ever do run across the Mirror of Erised, you will now be prepared.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
“You look odd.” What Harry feared most was that Harry might not be able to find the mirror room again.
----------------------------------------------
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, Mr. Dursley watched a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive in Mr. Dursley mirror.
----------------------------------------------
Breathing very fast, Harry turned slowly back to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
There Harry was, reflected in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, white and scared- looking, and there, reflected behind Harry, were at least ten others.
----------------------------------------------
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrelltalking and stop Quirrell from concentrating on the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
“And Sir, there’s one more thing ...” “Just the one?” “How did I get the Stone the Stone out of the mirror?” “Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that.
----------------------------------------------
the mirror’s almost like “D’you thought I had the right to face Lord Voldemort if I could.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heart was pounding far more furiously than when One book had screamed — for Harry had seen not only Harry in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
All my family are dead — let me have another look — ” “You had this mirror to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.” “You’re only holding the House Cup, whatFilch’sinteresting about that?
----------------------------------------------
turban closed turban eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry dropped the cloak from around Harry shoulders and ran to the mirror.
----------------------------------------------
“You may ask me one more thing, however.” “What do you see when you look in the Mirror of Erised?” “I?
----------------------------------------------
Harry was so close to the mirror now that Harry nose was nearly touching that of Harry reflection.
----------------------------------------------
NICHOLAS FLAMBL Dumbledore gently had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays an Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of Dumbledore gently trunk.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
And slowly, Harrylooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like Harry, other noses like Harry, even a little old man who looked as though Harry had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry Harry was looking at Harry family, for the first time in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Harry
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Each of a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of Harry — and they had an owl.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
----------------------------------------------
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
----------------------------------------------
There was somethin’ goin’ on that night Don hadn’t counted on — / dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped Don, all right.” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in Hagrid eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat down at the table and tried not to think about how Harry was going to look on Harry first day at Stonewall High — like Harry was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if the largest snake in the place had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long.
----------------------------------------------
At breakfast on Thursday Harry bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley’s and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on the animals favorite hobby of hitting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
a boy with a pale’s a sort of servant, isn’t a boy with a pale?” “a boy with a pale’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his own wand in the air.
----------------------------------------------
“But who’d be that desperate?” Harry wondered aloud.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share ...
----------------------------------------------
The trees were so thick Harry couldn’t see where Snapehad gone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry peered at the glass.
----------------------------------------------
“These two are the Bludgers.” He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the Quaffle.
----------------------------------------------
“It was a dream,” Harry told Harry firmly.
----------------------------------------------
When Dudley turned Dudley back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in Harry trousers.
----------------------------------------------
How long Harry stood there, Harry didn’t know.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, Ron just sat and gaped at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched, careful not to blink in case Harry missed case — but just as the oldest boyreached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of Harry and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the oldest boy had vanished.
----------------------------------------------
Harry caught sight of They and gave a squeal of delight.
----------------------------------------------
the animals ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley’s had a tantrum because Dudley’s knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought Dudley’s another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.
----------------------------------------------
“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps because it was dark, Harry didn’t recognize where Harry was at all.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve got to close in on his broom!” Harry called, not taking Harry eyes off a large silver key that had a bent wing with the damaged wing.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell raised Quirrell hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — “AAAARGH!” Quirrell rolled off Quirrell, Quirrell face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch Harry bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep his in enough pain to stop his from doing a curse.
----------------------------------------------
Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.” it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” always wanted a dragon, it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” told me so the first time I ever met a dragon,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but propped against the wall facing Harry was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.
----------------------------------------------
The youngest boy had already changed into The youngest boy billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on Harry chest with the letter P on it.
----------------------------------------------
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where Harry could see a tiny ray of hope.
----------------------------------------------
“Is it — dead?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.” Neville bent down and pulled his own wand out of the troll’s nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing Harry sweaty hair out of Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Weird).” Harry stared as Albus Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on Harry card and gave Harry a small smile.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
----------------------------------------------
“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where Harry had fallen and Harry mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.
----------------------------------------------
Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch they.” Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.
----------------------------------------------
Harry longed to know what a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor was, but knew better than to ask.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing Harry could say something a bit more interesting.
----------------------------------------------
Harry supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but this had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.
----------------------------------------------
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed his mouthquickly.
----------------------------------------------
As They jostled They way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
Harryleaned over the side of Harry own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron finally managed to find Harry and Ron way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor longest-ever punishment.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Harrywas halfway toward a door before Harry remembered what Harry’d promised Harry about not meddling.
----------------------------------------------
They peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell strode out of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
And slowly, Harrylooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like Harry, other noses like Harry, even a little old man who looked as though Harry had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry Harry was looking at Harry family, for the first time in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
Sure enough, Harry reflection looked back at Harry, just Harry head suspended in midair, Harry body completely invisible.
----------------------------------------------
“You must be Harry’s family!” said Fred Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.” Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.
----------------------------------------------
you go ...” “I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s that?” said one of the red-haired twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s lightning scar.
----------------------------------------------
Even at a distance there was no mistaking Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something a boy with a pale didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
The baby dragon wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella.
----------------------------------------------
How often had they complained how much Harry cost they to keep?
----------------------------------------------
Harry got slowly to Harry feet.
----------------------------------------------
“So what do your oldest brothers do now that your oldest brothers’ve left, anyway?” Harry was wondering what a wizard did once Harry’d finished school.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron Harry and Ron were thinking about what Harry and Ron were about to do.
----------------------------------------------
“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of a small cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in Stalagmite’s,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione stood up, Hermione crossed fingers in Hermione mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s just going to die?” “That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it?
----------------------------------------------
the reflection winked and put the Stone back in the Stone pocket — and as the reflection did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into its pocket.
----------------------------------------------
Harry face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Harry heard you.” “So?” said Neville , but Neville looked a bit uncomfortable.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione ’s cheers echoed around a brilliantly lit chamber.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley wondered whether Mr. Dursley dared tell Mr. Dursley Mr. Dursley’d heard “Harry.” Mr. Dursley decided Mr. Dursley didn’t dare.
----------------------------------------------
It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though Harry was petrified.
----------------------------------------------
“If that’s what I think it is — they’re really rare, and really valuable.” “What is it?” Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie’s eagle owl was always bringing Malfoy ’s eagle owl packages of sweets from home, which Harry opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: Harry took a great running jump and managed to fasten Harry arms around the troll’s neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” “But that means Nicolas and Nicolas wife will die, won’t he and his wife?” “he and his wife have enough Elixir stored to set he and his wife affairs in order and then, yes, he and his wife will die.” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
“For your information, “Harry Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful a sleeping potion is known as the Draught of Living Death.
----------------------------------------------
“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you, eh?” Harry said, leering at Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry said, Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ...
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s — go — just go.” Harry walked round and round Harry new room.
----------------------------------------------
“Did something happen to it when — Marcus Flint blocked Harry?” Seamus whispered.
----------------------------------------------
a drag — ” Harry looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as a drag — ” Harry towered over the three of them.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Harry stood quite still, Ron and Harry thinking the same thing — did the an Invisibility Cloak work on cats?
----------------------------------------------
“And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once Harry was sure Professorwas out of earshot.
----------------------------------------------
Although Harrycould tell it was daylight, Harry kept his eyes shut tight.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween.
----------------------------------------------
“She hasn’t got much time,” Ron added quickly, “you know, with five of us.” “Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with.
----------------------------------------------
“And that’s where ...” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.
----------------------------------------------
Harry kept Harry eyes fixed on the door.
----------------------------------------------
The lighted dial of Dudley’s’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the moth-eaten sofa on Dudley’s fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
ItNow Percy’s a prefect been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.” Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had gotten used to this by now, but the mail had given Harry a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until about a hundred owls saw about a hundred owls owners, and dropping letters and packages onto about a hundred owls laps.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrelltalking and stop Quirrell from concentrating on the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
Harry said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
----------------------------------------------
Once, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair so short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had laughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was already laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped glasses.
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
So where shall I put you?” Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through Harry, and Harryslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, One bookFilch’s shrieks still ringing in Harry ears.
----------------------------------------------
Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed Harry return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if Harry is delayed again, and again, why, Harry may never return to power.” Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made Harry head hurt.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
Griphook!” whistled and a small cart came hurtling up little railway tracks on the floor toward Harry, who had expected more marble.
----------------------------------------------
Filch and Snape couldn’t see Harry, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if came much nearer they’d knock right into Harry — an Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Harry from being solid.
----------------------------------------------
face Harry was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
A door stood ajar to Harry left.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been quite right to think Professor Binns wasn’t a teacher to cross.
----------------------------------------------
Up in the air, Snape turned on Snape broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past Snape, missing Snape by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, Harry arm raised in triumph, the Snitchclasped in the Snitch hand.
----------------------------------------------
“What?” Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what.
----------------------------------------------
“Light — speedy — we’ll have to get Harry a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule.
----------------------------------------------
She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora\” the lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through the lock, shut the lock quickly, and pressed they ears against the lock, listening.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case his gets lonely.” From inside a large crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though his teddy was having his teddy head torn off.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.
----------------------------------------------
I set myself against what is lurking in The forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside myself if I must.” And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best Harry could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind Ronan and Bane.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got some presents!” “What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to Ron own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.
----------------------------------------------
Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry remembered being picked for teams during gym at Harry old school.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.
----------------------------------------------
A centaur was standing over Harry, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; Harry had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
----------------------------------------------
Harry meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to Harry mouth, and what Harry said instead was, “Who are you?” A giant of a man chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
a pointed wizard’s hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of a pointed wizard’s hat at the moment.
----------------------------------------------
I hope this is one of those times.” Harry turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that Harry hadn’t tried.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
Walking back from the library on Harry own one afternoon, Harry heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Harry to get Harry attention and pointed at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Where are your parents?” “your parents’re dead,” said Harry shortly.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred and Georgeholding up Harry’s sweater.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” Harry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
----------------------------------------------
Magic carpets all got punctures, have Magic carpets all?” Harry didn’t say anything.
----------------------------------------------
“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.” Harry had a sudden idea.
----------------------------------------------
a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skinlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
After all, He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.” Harry shivered.
----------------------------------------------
All right there, Harry?” Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
----------------------------------------------
Harry the youngest Seeker had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, Harry’d managed to make it grow back .
----------------------------------------------
Harry!” Harry felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from Harry grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see Harry reflected in those misty eyes.
----------------------------------------------
It is not we business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in we forest!Firenze suddenly reared on to Firenze hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab Harry shoulders to stay on.
----------------------------------------------
I never saw Mighta bin a dragon dealer face, Mighta bin a dragon dealer kept Mighta bin a dragon dealer hood up.” Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.
----------------------------------------------
“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.
----------------------------------------------
“I know some things,” Harry said.
----------------------------------------------
Then a pain like Harry —’d never felt before pierced Harry — head; it was as though Harry — scar were on fire.
----------------------------------------------
“We’re nearly there,” Harry muttered suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shivered in the cold night air.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to Harry was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt strangely as though Harry had entered a very strict library; Harry swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to Harry and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl.
----------------------------------------------
For some reason, the back of Harry neck prickled.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wondered what the chains punishment was going to be.
----------------------------------------------
Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” The woman held up a letter so Dudley and Harry could read the green ink address: Mr. H.
----------------------------------------------
“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry piled Harry plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.
----------------------------------------------
“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron?
----------------------------------------------
Up another staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier.
----------------------------------------------
Harry did the best Harry could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in Harry forehead, which had been bothering Harry ever since Harry trip into the forest.
----------------------------------------------
One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was special, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as Mrs. Dursley opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky mouth.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Harry and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.
----------------------------------------------
Let’s try you out with a few of these.” Harry pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of Harry pocket and a few minutes later, Harry and Harry were up in the air, Oliver Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as Harry could in every direction for Harry to catch.
----------------------------------------------
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for Dumbledore, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at Harry scar.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy what Harry’d heard.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; Harry didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at they on the Underground, laden as much people were with all much people funny- shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap.
----------------------------------------------
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all about Harry and Ron first lessons.
----------------------------------------------
Harry peered out of the window.
----------------------------------------------
After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in Harry hand.
----------------------------------------------
Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Neville said to Harry Harry as Harry pushed Harry way into the crowded corridor, “Harry’s a nightmare, honestly.” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Out of the corner of Harry eye Harry saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.
----------------------------------------------
Harry scrambled to Harry feet, so happy Harry felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked carefully at Harry, astonishingly blue eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was walking backward at Harry, so that Voldemort could still see Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, let’s kick Mrs. Norris, just this once,” Harry whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
With a funny, muffled sort of thump Harry landed on something soft.
----------------------------------------------
The pain in Harry head lessened — Harry looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw Harry hunched in pain, looking at Harry fingers — they were blistering before Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
Now give me the Stone, unless you want your mother to have died in vain.” “NEVER!” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry woke early in the morning, however, the first thing Harry saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of Harry bed.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until Ron heard Ron say, “Hagrid!
----------------------------------------------
Smiling and waving at Harry from every page were Harry mother and father.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think the dragons’ll attack us if us cross the room?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Once Harry caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting Harry way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Oliver Wood was delighted.
----------------------------------------------
But Harry still didn’t open his eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Run by goblins.” Harry dropped the bit of sausage Harry was holding.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that Harry was holding more money than he’d had in Harry whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section.
----------------------------------------------
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to Harry so far.
----------------------------------------------
“I liked Ron a lot — great with animals.” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
----------------------------------------------
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty.
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned forward and grasped his broom tightly in both hands, and his broom shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
— Marcus Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.” It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past Harry head, that it happened.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Come to think of it, Potter wasn’t even sure Potter nephew was called Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, Hermione started looking frantically at the whole crowd.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, Snape’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did Snape just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but Harry wasn’t alone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled an Invisibility Cloak his head and Harry reflection vanished completely.
----------------------------------------------
Ron pulled one of four sandwiches apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t like corned beef.” “Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked back at the largest snake in the place and winked, too.
----------------------------------------------
Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” “Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told Harry brightly.
----------------------------------------------
Taking Harry to buy Harry things tomorrow.
----------------------------------------------
“The gold ones are Galleons,” Harry explained.
----------------------------------------------
A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as A lot of green smoke cleared, Harry gasped.
----------------------------------------------
This morning, however, She fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate.
----------------------------------------------
“Want to go first, Hermione?” “No, I don’t!” “All right.” Harry gritted Harry teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around Harry ankles were too tight: Harry tripped and fell over.
----------------------------------------------
If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, Harry hadmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told Harry so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
An’ you’ve kept fer him from Dumbledore all these years?” “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed Harry gripped Harry pink umbrella very tightly as Harry spoke.
----------------------------------------------
they tried retracing Harry’s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess.
----------------------------------------------
All right, Harry, Hermione?” “I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” , Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” ’re here to be punished, after all.” “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others.
----------------------------------------------
We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” “But there are hundreds of them!” Harry examined the lock on the door.
----------------------------------------------
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost their all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
----------------------------------------------
There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving his wand and saying a few funny words.
----------------------------------------------
Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got ter .” They settled down in The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine Harry flying.
----------------------------------------------
Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but Your platform don’t seem to have built Your platform yet, do Your platform?” Harry was quite right, of course.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
----------------------------------------------
“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.
----------------------------------------------
“I know Harry’s not very nice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the portrait hole .
----------------------------------------------
“Catch it if you can, then!” Harry shouted, and Harry threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.
----------------------------------------------
“That one!” Harry the youngest Seeker called to the others.
----------------------------------------------
And I’d bet my broomstick Harry let that troll in, to make a diversion!” Hermione’s eyes were wide.
----------------------------------------------
“I know what this is — this’s Devil’s Snare!” “Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s great help,” snarled Harry, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around Harry neck.
----------------------------------------------
a roaring fire filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over Harry as though Harry’d sunk into a hot bath.
----------------------------------------------
Guess who we just met on the train?” Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see Harry looking.
----------------------------------------------
Harry cleared Harry throat to let them know Harry was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of a rabbit, Harrythought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the Great Hall was now staring at a pointed wizard’s hat, Harry stared at a pointed wizard’s hat, too.
----------------------------------------------
Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in Harry class put together, but it made no difference, Harry hair simply grew that way — all over the place.
----------------------------------------------
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at They, and Harry knew that the only reason They weren’t already dead was that They sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is Ron?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d do with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one.
----------------------------------------------
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated.
----------------------------------------------
Getting up, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask Snape if Harry could have it.
----------------------------------------------
The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.
----------------------------------------------
“Nearly there!” Harry panted as Harry and Hermione reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.
----------------------------------------------
In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
----------------------------------------------
we’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” “Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heard something creak outside.
----------------------------------------------
Harry caught a glimpse of Harry face — and was startled to see that Harry was in tears.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was so close to the mirror now that Harry nose was nearly touching that of Harry reflection.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind Hermione Granger’s.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to its feet.
----------------------------------------------
“Mommy will never forget you!” How Harry and Hermione managed to get a large crate back up to the castle, Harry and Hermione never knew.
----------------------------------------------
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.
----------------------------------------------
Are you there?” “Coming, a small girl.” With a last look at Harry, the red-haired twins hopped off the train.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until the train gathered too much speed, then the boys’ mother fell back and waved.
----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “So proud, Harry Potter ..., I’m just so proud.” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in Harry excitement.
----------------------------------------------
I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed the story, too?” Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell Harry without words that this wasn’t true, because Nevillewas looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m sure it is — try it on.” Harry threw an Invisibility Cloak around Harry shoulders and Rongave a yell.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped off Harry broom, a foot from the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Something gold was glinting just above Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering...
----------------------------------------------
Hermione and Neville didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because Hermione and Neville weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to Hermione and Neville, either.
----------------------------------------------
This, Harry supposed, was that car crash, though Harry couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with Dudley’s, but before His aunt and uncle’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
----------------------------------------------
“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins Harry’d followed through the barrier.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood .
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys had received a very angry letter from his money’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.
----------------------------------------------
Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse?
----------------------------------------------
Then Hagrid voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry pulled the door open.
----------------------------------------------
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned a knight, a bishop, and a castle backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Harry, and Hermione took.
----------------------------------------------
the troll mean little eyes saw Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wasn’t sure Harry could explain.
----------------------------------------------
“I want — ” Harry began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing three letters before Uncle Vernon eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Use the boy ...” Quirrell rounded on Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry astonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing,” Harry lied.
----------------------------------------------
“Keep playing,” Harry warned Harry as they slipped out of cloak and crept toward the trapdoor.
----------------------------------------------
For a moment, Harry was sure Harry’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid , raising Hagrid binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
----------------------------------------------
his eyes felt as though Harry was sitting on some sort of plant.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering Harry and Ron laughter at HALLOWEEN Malfoy obvious rage and confusion.
----------------------------------------------
They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled Harry back by the scruff of Harry neck.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked down at Harry empty gold plate.
----------------------------------------------
“See?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle in somehow.” Harry was strongly reminded of even Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; Harry head felt as though it was about to split in two; Harry yelled, struggling with all Harry might, and to Harry surprise, Quirrell let go of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“See what I have become?” a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen said.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d have thought you, of all people — ” “I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed.
----------------------------------------------
Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker.
----------------------------------------------
The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Harry as they stepped over Harry and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harryswore to Harry not to meddle in things that weren’t Harry business from now on.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared through his binoculars.
----------------------------------------------
“Typical,” said Harry darkly.
----------------------------------------------
You look terrible.” Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
----------------------------------------------
OUT!Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw Harry into the hall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pressed on through a small crowd until Harry found an empty compartment near the end of the train.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.
----------------------------------------------
“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
----------------------------------------------
Yet something had been nagging at the back of Harry mind all day.
----------------------------------------------
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
...” “Stop saying the name!” said Harry in a terrified whisper, as if Harry thought Voldemort could hear them.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more feeble than the last.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t be a fool,” snarled a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagridstared wildly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Cold, damp air rushed past Harry as Harry fell down, down, down and — FLUMP.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared at a note.
----------------------------------------------
Nobody bothered I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept to He, Ron, and Hermione, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.
----------------------------------------------
Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century.
----------------------------------------------
The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than Harry felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than Harry or Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” “Oh, Neville,” Harry heard the old woman sigh.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had turned white.
----------------------------------------------
If A woman standing right behind his reflection was really there, Harry’d touch A woman standing right behind his reflection, their reflections were so close together, but Harry felt only air — A woman standing right behind his reflection and the others existed only in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back Harry courage.
----------------------------------------------
— knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?” Harry thought this was going a bit far.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harrywere just a few of Uncle Vernon favorite subjects.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had always been last to be chosen, not because Harry was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Ron appeared out of nowhere as Ron pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
The harder His Aunt Petunia tried to pull The over His Aunt Petunia head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Three of them are called Chasers.” “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Oliver Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had to clap his hands to Harry mouth to stop Harry from screaming.
----------------------------------------------
You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” Both Harry and Ron stood up.
----------------------------------------------
Harry let the material flow over Harry hands, smoother than silk, light as air.
----------------------------------------------
If we try anything we we’ll be thrown out for sure.” “But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“My name is Firenze,” My name added, as My name lowered My name on to My name front legs so that Harry could clamber onto Harry back.
----------------------------------------------
Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on Harry, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup.
----------------------------------------------
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled People as People moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
----------------------------------------------
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, Harry had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and Harry had no idea how to do it; Harry was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk Harry could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Let me think — let me think ...” The white queen turned The white queen blank face toward Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Good luck, Harry,” Albus Dumbledore murmured.
----------------------------------------------
What if Harry just sat there with the hat over Harry eyes for ages, until Professor jerked it off Harry head and said there had obviously been a mistake and Harry’d better get back on the train?
----------------------------------------------
“Urn — Hagrid?” “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on Harry huge boots.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tore Harry eyes away from Harry motherFilch’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled back Harry bangs to show the lightning scar.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was so huge that Hagrid parted the crowd easily; Harry Harry had to do was keep close behind Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
A large black and silver volume caught Harry eye.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and The problem was just no good telling the Dursleys Harry didn’t make the Dursleys happen.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione know things ...
----------------------------------------------
The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was now dangling from a wild jerk, holding on with only one hand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry mother and father beamed at the sight of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, bewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
----------------------------------------------
No one ever lived after No one decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’ No one’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.” Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind.
----------------------------------------------
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for Ron, and the other Gryffindors first flying lesson.
----------------------------------------------
Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years!
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting cloak behind Harry back.
----------------------------------------------
“his eyes’s okay!” Harry called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “his eyes’s a soft landing, you can jump!” Harry followed right away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as Harry, Ron and Hermione had lost black ones.
----------------------------------------------
As far as Harry had seen, the largest snake in the place hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at Piers and Dudley heels as the largest snake in the place passed, but by the time Piers and Dudley were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley’s was telling Piers and Dudley how the largest snake in the place had nearly bitten off Dudley’s leg, while Piers was swearing the largest snake in the place had tried to squeeze Dudley’s to death.
----------------------------------------------
a hooded figure got to a hooded figure feet and came swiftly toward Harry — Harry — couldn’t move for fear.
----------------------------------------------
One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade ) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT wand cauldron (pewter, standard size ) set glass or crystal phials telescope set brass scales Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS “Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.
----------------------------------------------
And what model is it?” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face.
----------------------------------------------
No one does.” “Why not?” “Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared.
----------------------------------------------
curious “Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with Mr. Ollivander pale stare.
----------------------------------------------
“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping him forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Harry lit a lamp to see Harry way along the rows of books.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled his eye out with difficulty, because his eye was very heavy, and, balancing his eye on Harry knee, let his eye fall open.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned Harry sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
----------------------------------------------
a hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down a hooded figure front.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
Harry whirled around.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, how many times in our lives are our going to see a dragon hatching?” “our’ve got lessons, our’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone finds out what someone ’s doing — ” “Shut up!” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ don’ say the name!” “VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, Harry stopped crying.
----------------------------------------------
NICHOLAS FLAMBL Dumbledore gently had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays an Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of Dumbledore gently trunk.
----------------------------------------------
“Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed The boa constrictor at a little sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo.
----------------------------------------------
C’mere and help!” With the red-haired twins ’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of an empty compartment near the end of the train.
----------------------------------------------
Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, Harry kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry?
----------------------------------------------
I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep it safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew someone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
So what do we do, Harry?” The light of adventure was kindling again in Harry’seyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package from Harry in Harry’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
“ Potter , did Anne” say?” “ “ Potter?” The last thing Harry saw before a pointed wizard’s hat dropped over Harry eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
...” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over Professor McGonagall glasses at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” Dudley’s passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry Dudley’s had never tasted anything so wonderful, but Dudley’s still couldn’t take His eyes off A giant of a man.
----------------------------------------------
” Harry leapt into the air; Harry’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\ Lights clicked on upstairs and to Harry horror Harryrealized that the big, squashy something had been Harry uncle’s face.
----------------------------------------------
“Out of the way, you,” Dudley’s said, punching Harry in the ribs.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw Harry clap Harry hand to Harry mouth as though was about to be sick — hit the field on all fours Higgs — coughed — and something gold fell into .
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and a wizard cracker didn’t just bang, a wizard cracker went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice.
----------------------------------------------
Just as Ronstarted moaning that Ron feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with the wooden door windows glowing red in the setting sun.
----------------------------------------------
Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s mouth went rather dry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of Harry on Harry and Ron very first morning.
----------------------------------------------
And there were Harry mother and father smiling at Harry again, and one of Harry grandfathers nodding happily.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, I can’t breathe.” Harry pulled open another door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Neville , and Hermione moved closer together to block a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from view; Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into Yeh beard.
----------------------------------------------
In a matter of seconds, though, Harry was wide- eyed as Harry began to tell Harry and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
----------------------------------------------
Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s that’s — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all come an’ find Harry — so, be careful — let’s go.” The forest was black and silent.
----------------------------------------------
Harry raised wand above Harry head, brought wand swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.
----------------------------------------------
“I mean, yes, I am.” The two boys gawked at Harry, and Harry felt Harry turning red.
----------------------------------------------
It was a few seconds before Harry noticed anything about the room Harry had hidden in.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you hear something?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for Harry age.
----------------------------------------------
Now Harry came to think about it .
----------------------------------------------
Harry paid seven gold Galleons for Harry wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed seven gold Galleons from Mr. Ollivander shop.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry looked up at Harry Harry and said, “If anything happens to Harry, don’t follow.
----------------------------------------------
“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” Dudley’s told Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although Harry might be warmer if the roof did.
----------------------------------------------
Harry glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending the youngest redheaded boy hadn’t looked.
----------------------------------------------
With one last desperate look back at Harry, Harry and Hermionecharged through the door and up the next passageway.
----------------------------------------------
Harry cheered up a bit when Harry found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.
----------------------------------------------
Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Harry, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
The white queen struck Harry hard across the head with The white queen stone arm, and Harry crashed to the floor — Hermionescreamed but stayed on The white queen square — The white queen dragged Harry to one side.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
Why didn’t I see it before?” “What are you talking about?” said Harry, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.
----------------------------------------------
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along a hidden passageway and came out near they Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door.
----------------------------------------------
Wherever Harry was, Filch must know a shortcut, because Harry soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to Harry horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section in the library?
----------------------------------------------
The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching.
----------------------------------------------
I hate them Gringotts carts.” Harry did still look a bit sick, so Harryentered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.
----------------------------------------------
“You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” Harry put on a high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong.
----------------------------------------------
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
Yesterday Harry’d have given anything to be up here.
----------------------------------------------
“That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.” Harry went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off Harry broom.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before Harry get ter that level.” Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down Dudley bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley’s turned the table over.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped out of bed and wrapped an Invisibility Cloak around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d not say no ter summat stronger if got , mind.” Harry eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in His eyes and Harry snorted.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking It as they watched a gorilla scratching It head who looked remarkably like Dudley’s, except that it wasn’t blond.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
----------------------------------------------
Then He’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on Harry bucking broomstick.
----------------------------------------------
Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think Fred was joking.” Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt.
----------------------------------------------
“Stay on the path, I’ll come back for Harry!” the unicorns heard Harry crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until the unicorns couldn’t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around the unicorns.
----------------------------------------------
With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, Harry remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t until Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
----------------------------------------------
“ Fluffy ?” “Yeah — bought off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent to Dumbledore to guard the — ” “Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Harry ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.
----------------------------------------------
Where’s Mommy?” “The baby dragon’s lost The baby dragon marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that Harry had pockets rattling with gold and silver Harry was ready to buy Mars Bars as Harry could carry — but a smiling, dimpled woman didn’t have Mars Bars.
----------------------------------------------
“I might get lucky again.” Hermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked quickly over Harry shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding they inside the box.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
We’ll be off, then.” Harry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, staring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked Harry and Hermione view.
----------------------------------------------
There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be carefull” “You drink first,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat up and felt around, Harry eyes not used to the gloom.
----------------------------------------------
Sometimes, when Harry strained Harry memory during long hours in Harry cupboard, Harry came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on Harry forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to Harry, buried deep under London.
----------------------------------------------
Written in narrow, loopy writing Harry had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before Your father died.
----------------------------------------------
What a smiling, dimpled woman did have were Now Percy’s a prefect Every Flavor Beans, Bertie Bott’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
“What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep Harry head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question.
----------------------------------------------
...” “I can only see you.” “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, Harry couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ronin Harry paisley pajamas.
----------------------------------------------
I told My mom you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” Ron groaned, “My mom’s made you a Weasley sweater.” Harry had torn open a very lumpy parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull Hermione toward the door, but Hermione couldn’t move, Hermione was still flat against the wall, Hermione mouth open with terror.
----------------------------------------------
every odd thing that had ever made Harry aunt and uncle furious with Harry had happened when Harry, Harry, had been upset or angry ...
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
We think Harry was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.” Hagrid dropped the teapot.
----------------------------------------------
KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry!
----------------------------------------------
I heard a boy with a pale’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then a boy with a pale gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to a boy with a pale bed.” “I think Hagrid’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had the best morning Harry’d had in a long time.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made Harry sick.
----------------------------------------------
the white pieces moved silently wherever Harry sent the white pieces.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron jumped to Harry and Ron feet.
----------------------------------------------
“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry lowered Harry through the hole until Harry was hanging on by Harry fingertips.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ignored Ron and spoke to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by Harry stunned face that Harry hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
----------------------------------------------
It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything Harry owned from this cupboard to this room.
----------------------------------------------
“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” Harry felt Harry go red.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had just thought of something that made Harry feel as though the happy balloon inside Harry had got a puncture.
----------------------------------------------
I see Dumbledore gently holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle.
----------------------------------------------
THE POTIONS MASTER “There, look.” “Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see Harry face?” “Did you see Harry scar?” Whispers followed Harry from the moment Harry left Harry dormitory the next day.
----------------------------------------------
“Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before a pointed wizard’s hat declared him a Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween!
----------------------------------------------
“My mistake, My mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie Peevsie little joke, sir.” “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Harryl” Hermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” again, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry head was still very sore.
----------------------------------------------
“Ready?” Harry called, Harry face pale but determined.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
“And have you really got — you know ...” Ron pointed at Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Oh my goodness — Vernon!” They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley’s were still in the room.
----------------------------------------------
Somehow — incredibly — Harry’d gotten the Stone.
----------------------------------------------
“We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.” When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off Harry feelings.
----------------------------------------------
a lamp looked as if a lamp was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel Harry arm supporting a lamp, the sight gave Harry the creeps.
----------------------------------------------
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of Uncle Vernon newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.
----------------------------------------------
the whole crowd was on the whole crowd feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of the whole crowd brooms, but it was no good — every time the whole crowd got near Ron, his broom would jump higher still.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on, but Harry didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to Harry legs.
----------------------------------------------
Harry heart was pounding far more furiously than when One book had screamed — for Harry had seen not only Harry in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to Harry feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and Ron muttered that Ron’d brought sandwiches.
----------------------------------------------
Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” “Are there many of Harry and Hermione in here?” asked Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry dropped the cloak from around Harry shoulders and ran to the mirror.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s the matter?” In a low whisper, Harry told them what Harry’d seen.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as Harry could remember, ever since Harry’d been a baby and Harry parents had died in that car crash.
----------------------------------------------
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in.
----------------------------------------------
Snape hadn’t seen a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but Snape seemed to be looking for a reason to tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione off anyway.
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
I bet Harry expected you to refuse, anyway.” “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” “Throw it away and punch ” on the nose,” Ronsuggested.
----------------------------------------------
“What’ve you done to ?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, “That’s — er ...” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
----------------------------------------------
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever Harry told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry went straight to the window and jerked the window open.
----------------------------------------------
“Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” “The floor?” Harry suggested.
----------------------------------------------
Fang rested Fang head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over Fang robes.
----------------------------------------------
Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
----------------------------------------------
yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran Hagridfingers through Yeh hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
----------------------------------------------
old Mrs. Figg let Harry watch television and gave Harry a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though old Mrs. Figg’d had ’d for several years.
----------------------------------------------
To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.” Harry had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” Harry ignored Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
“Take this.” He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
----------------------------------------------
Harry landed next to Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Malkin’s stood Harry on a stool next to Madam Malkin’s, slipped a long robe over Madam Malkin’s head, and began to pin a long robe to the right length.
----------------------------------------------
As the largest snake in the place slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, BrazilBrazil, here I come.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never seen so many things Harry liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville’s robes’re in here somewhere,” Neville’s robes heard Harry mutter, “probably hiding.” “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, the others began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.
----------------------------------------------
Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Harry written on a slightly squashed box in green icing.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, “Harry Potter?” Harry forced Harry to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“I won’t blow up The whole house smelled of cabbage,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harryhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on they foreheads, but Harry and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about The Sorcerer’s Stone as HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
Look down!” Harry looked down at Harry feet, but they were gone.
----------------------------------------------
Potter Room Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for a letter but Uncle Vernonknocked Uncle Vernon hand out of the way.
----------------------------------------------
What’s the matter?” “Nothing,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wasn’t a very good player yet and old chessmen kept shouting different bits of advice at Harry, which was confusing.
----------------------------------------------
A woman standing right behind Harry reflection was smiling at Harry and waving.
----------------------------------------------
Harry started to direct the white pieces.
----------------------------------------------
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table.
----------------------------------------------
the troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up even a troll nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in Harry hand when Harry’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.
----------------------------------------------
Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry pulled back Harry sheets, Harry found Harry Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath his sheets.
----------------------------------------------
Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” Harry stood up.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry still had a black mark on Harry nose.
----------------------------------------------
There Harry was, reflected in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, white and scared- looking, and there, reflected behind Harry, were at least ten others.
----------------------------------------------
“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “We were on the team last year.” “Shut up, you two,” said Wood.
----------------------------------------------
jus’ don’ let on much.” “D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side.
----------------------------------------------
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt a sudden warmth in Harry fingers.
----------------------------------------------
the trolldidn’t even seem to notice a metal pipe hitting a metal pipe shoulder, but a metal pipe heard the yell and paused again, turning a metal pipe ugly snout toward Neville instead, giving Harry time to run around a metal pipe.
----------------------------------------------
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see “Charlie’s in Romania twin brothers catcalling.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry and Ron walked back to the main castle for dinner, Harry and Ron pockets weighed down with rock cakes Harry and Ron ’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given Harry as much to think about as tea with Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
And don’t you dare let the bacon burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” Harry groaned.
----------------------------------------------
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling The white mice were going to end up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.
----------------------------------------------
Finally Harry said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of Harry are that good at chess — “we’re not offended,” said Harry quickly.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Flitwick told me all about the special circumstances, Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once.
----------------------------------------------
Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
----------------------------------------------
the top parcel was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across the top parcel was To Harry, from Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but Pig won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “How’s your arm?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made Harry look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.
----------------------------------------------
“ Harry Potter,” chorused the red-haired twins .
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
how very curious ...” Mr. Ollivander put Harry’s wand back into Harry’s box and wrapped its box in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious .
----------------------------------------------
“Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.” Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and The owlheld out Harry leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to the money.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch Neville eye).
----------------------------------------------
“ didn’t catch it, nearly swallowed it,” — Marcus Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.
----------------------------------------------
“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.” Harry stepped forward, and The white queen pounced.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only hear Harry’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.” Harry Harry woke early the next morning.
----------------------------------------------
his relief walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to his relief footsteps dying away.
----------------------------------------------
It might’ve been happening while we were there!” There was no doubt about It, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time.
----------------------------------------------
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Harry, peering over the dog’s back.
----------------------------------------------
Not until Harry climbed into bed was Harry free to think about Not until he climbed into bed: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent Not until he climbed into bed.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Albus Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that Harry was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
Harry father’s ...
----------------------------------------------
“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” “Well,” Hermione exploded, “if “D’you did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” “No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had taken one step toward Harry when a slithering sound made Harry freeze where Harry stood.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could mention this, Hagrid had steered Harry inside.
----------------------------------------------
“I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met Dumbledore in the entrance hall — Dumbledore already knew — Dumbledore just said, ‘Harry’s gone after Harry, hasn’t Harry?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” “D’you think “D’you meant you to do “D’you?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was faster than Terence Higgs — Harry could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — Harry put on an extra spurt of speed — WHAM!
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
“They’re not really frogs, are They?” Harry was starting to feel that nothing would surprise Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, He had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next.
----------------------------------------------
When the ghost of Professor Binns told they to put down they quills and roll up they parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest.
----------------------------------------------
What’s your surname, anyway?” But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin’s said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” Harry said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.
----------------------------------------------
Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrellignored Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, Harry stomach rumbling with hunger.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because Percy was so tired and full of food.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched the girl and the boys’ mother mother disappear as the train rounded the corner.
----------------------------------------------
...” Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.
----------------------------------------------
“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
----------------------------------------------
Once, Harry thought Harry saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — them plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, Harry could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what the red-haired twins were saying.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned Harry head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside they, the people doing they shopping.
----------------------------------------------
“Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.” “Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on Seamus sausages.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. “I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and Hermione had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
----------------------------------------------
Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell Harry something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the largest snake in the place.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, are you all right?” Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
what an honor.” Harry hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry Harry and seized Harry hand, tears in Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had just finished telling Ronwhat had happened when Harry’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
After all, Harry’d never had any money in Harry life until a month ago, and Harry told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
----------------------------------------------
Forgetting that Harry and Hermione were already invisible, Harry and Hermione shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had no friends, no other relatives — Harry didn’t belong to the library, so Harry’d never even got rude notes asking for books back.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” Harry was rubbing Harry forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing we, Harry Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses askew.
----------------------------------------------
They made They way through the trees in silence for so long that Harrythought Firenze didn’t want to talk to Harry anymore.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry squeezed through A door, holding Harry breath, trying not to move A door, and to Harry relief Harry managed to get inside the room without his relief noticing anything.
----------------------------------------------
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had had it as long as Harry could remember, and the first question Harry could ever remember asking His Aunt Petunia was how Harry had gotten it.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t allowed Harry Potter.” Ron couldn’t resist it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who had expected more marble were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches.
----------------------------------------------
And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes, but not to us,” said Harry in exasperation.
----------------------------------------------
Sir, I — ” Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.” Harry swallowed and looked around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Then a sudden movement ahead of Harry and Hermione made Harry and Hermione almost drop a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
Snape caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape ’s feelings toward Snape hadn’t changed one jot.
----------------------------------------------
“Better get the cloak,” Harry muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning.
----------------------------------------------
Harrymust have walked straight past Harry, so desperate to get to the mirror Harry hadn’t noticed Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and Harry and Ron were quite keen to have another one.
----------------------------------------------
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, us give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in dwarf nor giant insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste twins, though different at first sight Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that Hermione was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry had found Harry voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent his voice to me?” “Ah — your father happened to leave his voice in my possession, and I thought you might like his voice.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take Harry away, but it had never happened; the Dursleyswere Harry only family.
----------------------------------------------
With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock the key.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley’s had punched Harry on the nose.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron stared at Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
the knights horse pawed the ground and a black knightturned a black knight helmeted head to look down at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked over Harry shoulder to read her shoulder: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among us number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.
----------------------------------------------
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent Harry, and old chessmen didn’t trust Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by Harry old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
----------------------------------------------
Dark days, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Look — ” Harry murmured, holding out Harry arm to stop Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s always sp- spoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with Dudley’s .
----------------------------------------------
Harry was thinking about this time Yesterday and bitterly wishing Harry’d opened the letter in the hall.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until Harry was out of sight; Harry rose in Harry seat and pressed Harry nose against the window, but Harry blinked and Hagrid had gone.
----------------------------------------------
The reflections did not fade and Harry looked and looked until a distant noise brought Harry back to Harry senses.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
----------------------------------------------
Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow Harry as quickly as possible; “Sniff around, my sweet scurried silently toward the door, away from the Fat Lady’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
Help me, “Master!” And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
All Harry and Ron really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to Harry and Ron great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
----------------------------------------------
Come on, Harry.” Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
----------------------------------------------
Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared at Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Harry now had Hermione as a friend had also lent Harry Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.
----------------------------------------------
Harry gripped His broom tightly with both Harry hands and knees.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt the package from Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.
----------------------------------------------
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and Harry leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first Harry thought it was empty.
----------------------------------------------
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but Harry wasn’t very hopeful.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what Harry’d been trying to do.
----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.” My father turned back to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry tried to understand this but this made Harry head pound, so Harry stopped.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take Harry mind off Harry nerves about tomorrow.
----------------------------------------------
“I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” “Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been doing Malfoy wrong for years.
----------------------------------------------
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter ...” face Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane Professor McGonagall was going to use on Harry?
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagridwants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in a dragon pocket?
----------------------------------------------
Harry kept looking around.
----------------------------------------------
He’d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. “Will you stop messing around!” Harry yelled.
----------------------------------------------
’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” Harry turned this news over in Harry mind.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
Harry mounted his broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up Harry soared; air rushed through Harry hair, and Harry robes whipped out behind Harry — and in a rush of fierce joy Harry realized Harry’d found something Harry could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful.
----------------------------------------------
And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can Gryffindor?” Harry flushed.
----------------------------------------------
“ thinks the door is locked,” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve met Draco Malfoy before?” Harry explained about — Crabbe and Malfoy meeting in Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Exactly why Dudley’s wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley’s was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody.
----------------------------------------------
Know who black-haired boy who was near us in is?” “Who?” “ Harry Potted” Harry heard the little girl’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Harry wheeled round.
----------------------------------------------
“If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling Neville to do something desperate.
----------------------------------------------
“How did Harry get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.
----------------------------------------------
Harry swung at Harry’s face with the bat to stop Harry’s face from breaking Harry nose, and sent Harry’s face zigzagging away into the air — Harry’s face zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of Harry’s face and managed to pin Harry’s face to the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that Harry had fewer nightmares when Harry was tired out after training.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice Harry dropped it painfully on Harry foot.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.” “I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though Harry wasn’t sure the largest snake in the place could hear Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Sir — even if Harry’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” “Call Sir Voldemort, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley and Harry had just finished when the owner of a gloomy- looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city came over to Dudley and Harry table.
----------------------------------------------
“The thing is — The thing is, I don’t know how to — ” “How to get onto the platform?” the plump woman said kindly, and Harry nodded.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given Harry for Christmas.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
Several boys of about Harry age had Several boys of about Harry’s age noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.
----------------------------------------------
So — think you’ve got all that?” “Three The Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep The Bludgers away from the Beaters ,” Harry reeled off.
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t make out the look on Harry face, but Harry was stuttering worse than ever.
----------------------------------------------
It was so dark on either side of ” Slipping and stumbling that Harry thought there must be thick trees there.
----------------------------------------------
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an unexpected test.
----------------------------------------------
“Hungry, are you?” “Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it would go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was going to smash right into the barrier and then Harry’d be in trouble — leaning forward on Harry cart, Ron broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — Harry wouldn’t be able to stop — his cart was out of control — Ron was a foot away — Ron closed Ron eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come ...
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.” Harry unwrapped Harry Chocolate Frog and picked up the card.
----------------------------------------------
The white king took off The white king crown and threw his crown at Harry’s feet.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s Percy doing?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
“Here I come,” Harry said, and Harry drained the smallest bottlein one gulp.
----------------------------------------------
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
----------------------------------------------
his broom had started to roll over and over, with Harry only just managing to hold on.
----------------------------------------------
Harry climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.
----------------------------------------------
The weirdest thing about all these people was the way all these people seemed to vanish Harry Harry tried to get a closer look.
----------------------------------------------
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad Harry fell to Harry knees.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione would never let Harry, Ron, and Hermione copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking Hermione to read it through, Harry, Ron, and Hermione got the right answers anyway.
----------------------------------------------
“Dunno what Harry thinks Harry’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled.
----------------------------------------------
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous.
----------------------------------------------
d’yeh like it?” Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“All right?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
----------------------------------------------
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve just got to make sure We play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on We.” Which was all very well, thought Harry, but Harry had another reason for not wanting Snape near Harry while Harry was playing Quidditch.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but Dudley’s couldn’t often catch Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ go shoutin’ about shoutin, what’s the matter with yeh?” “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” “SHHHH!” said Hagrid again.
----------------------------------------------
You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment The blood of a unicorn touches your lips.” Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.
----------------------------------------------
People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at Harry, or doubled back to pass Harry in the corridors again, staring.
----------------------------------------------
When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?” “You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly.
----------------------------------------------
sounds like wings to Harry.” “There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.” the dragons reached the end of The passageway and saw before the dragons a brilliantly lit chamber, a brilliantly lit chamber ceiling arching high above the dragons.
----------------------------------------------
The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.
----------------------------------------------
It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for wand when wand brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” Harry swallowed.
----------------------------------------------
“I think well be okay — get off Neville !” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore sat down next to Harry, took one look at Dumbledore, and burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
Tell they us don’t want — ” Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.
----------------------------------------------
“But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about — ” “ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Harrythink.
----------------------------------------------
Blood was pounding in Harry ears.
----------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into the team scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest They, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” A lamp flickered on.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and ’s going to be as long as your house.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had a powerful kind of ache inside Harry, half joy, half terrible sadness.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled Harry up a little to take his broomstick even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
----------------------------------------------
There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, Harry knew, but Harry must be five floors above there.
----------------------------------------------
Poor, blundering Neville Harry knew what it must have cost Harry to try and find Neville was looking stunned and hurt in the dark, to warn Neville was looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
“No more studying,” Harry sighed happily, stretching out on the grass.
----------------------------------------------
After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, Harry the youngest Seeker noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if he had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
----------------------------------------------
To the exam results were still to come great surprise, both Harry and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
“Mount your brooms, please.” Harry clambered onto Harry Nimbus Two Thousand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wondered if Harry should get out Harry wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.
----------------------------------------------
Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped Ropes tightly around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ” “See you later, then,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt so ashamed of Harry that Harry went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.
----------------------------------------------
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as Harry joined Hermione by the wall, wiping sweat off Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat down on the bed and stared around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as Ron poured sugar on Ron porridge.
----------------------------------------------
“I found out something about Harry,” Harry told Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Now Harry was back to staring around for the Snitch .
----------------------------------------------
The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts.
----------------------------------------------
Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating anything?” Harry couldn’t eat.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then Harry noticed that A woman standing right behind his reflection was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time.
----------------------------------------------
Didn’t us swear when us took — ” in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?” That evening when — ” got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something — ” ’d never done before; ’dvisited Harry in — ” cupboard.
----------------------------------------------
“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry put the smallest bottle down and walked forward; Harry braced Harry, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel the black flames — for a moment Harry could see nothing but dark fire — then Harry was on the other side, in the last chamber.
----------------------------------------------
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, Harry thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does.
----------------------------------------------
“I think RonNow Percy’s a prefect been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry knew Harry ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken Mrs. Figg leg, but it wasn’t easy when Mrs. Figg reminded Mrs. Figg it would be a whole year before Mrs. Figg had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.
----------------------------------------------
And did Hagrid know something about Snape that Snape didn’t want to tell Harry?
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah,” said Harry, “and Harry Harry doesn’t lose Harry head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
----------------------------------------------
Over the rustling of the trees, Harry seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told Harry on the night they had met: “Some say Harry died.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to take a step backward but Harry legs wouldn’t move.
----------------------------------------------
“It was only a dream.” But Harry wished Harry hadn’t said anything.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley’s won, so Harry, Harry glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on Harry stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
----------------------------------------------
“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” “Yes,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time Fred and George ’ve been here, and people still like Fred and George .” “Fred and George ’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have Fred and George ?” said Harry miserably.
----------------------------------------------
“Go back to bed!” “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — your brother’s a prefect, your brother’d put a stop to this.” Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned to face the black flames.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d ’d go?
----------------------------------------------
“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER!Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as Snape dropped his robes above his knees quickly to hide Snape leg.
----------------------------------------------
Excitement flooded through Harry as Harry stood there in the dark and silence.
----------------------------------------------
Harryglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as Harry was; Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though.
----------------------------------------------
There was nothing to stop Harry from staying here all night with Harry family.
----------------------------------------------
Harry opened a slightly squashed box with trembling fingers.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you smell something?” Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached Harry nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
----------------------------------------------
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
the people in the portraits along the corridors climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging the people in the portraits along the corridors feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther the people in the portraits along the corridors had to go when the people in the portraits along the corridors came to a sudden halt.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as Muggle called it, gave the bills to Harry so Muggle could buy Hagrid, who didn’t tickets.
----------------------------------------------
But the news that Harry was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harrydidn’t know which was worse — people telling Harry Harry’d be brilliant or people telling Harry — people’d be running around underneath Harry holding a mattress.
----------------------------------------------
“The smallest bottle will get The smallest bottlethrough the black fire — toward the Stone.” Harry looked at The smallest bottle.
----------------------------------------------
“Everywhere else is full.” Harry shook Harry head and the youngest redheaded boy sat down.
----------------------------------------------
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and Harry stared hungrily back at The Potters, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though Harry was hoping to fall right through the glass and reach The Potters.
----------------------------------------------
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
“You’d think We dragged Hermione along, wouldn’t you?” But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as Ron climbed back into bed.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.
----------------------------------------------
Half blinded, Harry — staggered backward.
----------------------------------------------
“Which is your wand arm?” “Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
— it likes the dark and the damp — ” “So light a fire!” Harry choked.
----------------------------------------------
Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.
----------------------------------------------
Harrystuck his own wand up Harry nose and Neville knocked his own wand out with his own wand own club.
----------------------------------------------
And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.” Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between Harry nostrils, was doing this on this own.
----------------------------------------------
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry to do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t speak to Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
his money’s can’t take Atta boy, Dudley!”.” his money’s jerked his money’s head in Harry’s direction.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around Harry chest.
----------------------------------------------
“I think,” said Harry, “We’re going to have to be chessmen.” Harry walked up to a black knight and put Harry hand out to touch the knights horse.
----------------------------------------------
Next second Harry was looking at the black inside of a pointed wizard’s hat.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy!” hissed Neville , pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas!” “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.
----------------------------------------------
Panicking, Harry heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing One book back on the bottom shelf, Harry ran for One book.
----------------------------------------------
Midnight ticked nearer as Harry and Hermione heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve heard of Harry family,” said Ron darkly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook Harry awake.
----------------------------------------------
A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and a pointed wizard’s hat began to sing: “Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat Harry if you can find A smarter hat than Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?” Harry looked into the fire.
----------------------------------------------
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found Harry shaking hands with everyone in The Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN this large parcel AT THE TABLE.
----------------------------------------------
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul had happened during a World Cup match in ; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, that’s it — any questions?” Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
“You look odd.” What Harry feared most was that Harry might not be able to find the mirror room again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry snapped One book shut, but A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harrysat down next to Ron, “I need to concern” Harry caught sight of Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
At times, Harry even wondered whether Snapewas following Harry, trying to catch Harry on Harry own.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but Harry kept them wide open.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got to Harry feet.
----------------------------------------------
Please leave your luggage on The train, The train will be taken to the school separately.” Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, Ron saw, looked pale under Ron freckles.
----------------------------------------------
“I needn’t have learned about the Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Harry said this made Harry feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
----------------------------------------------
“Then kill Harry, fool, and be done!” screeched Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read Harry newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while people did this, but it was very difficult, Harry’d never had so many questions in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had written only two words: It’s a Norwegian Ridge-back hatching.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig.
----------------------------------------------
“What do you see?” Harry screwed up Harry courage.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll kill Fred, Fred was going on about wrestling a troll.” Harry smiled weakly.
----------------------------------------------
Over and over again Harry dreamed about Harry parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
----------------------------------------------
You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when Wood told Fred and George Weasley.” “Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood reckons Wood The boy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in we first week.
----------------------------------------------
If Harry think yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an’ pack.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed the door ajar and peered inside — and a horrible scene met Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Hmm,” said a small voice in Harry ear.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
Five points from Gryffindor.” “He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.
----------------------------------------------
Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban.
----------------------------------------------
Right, NOW!” Harry dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.
----------------------------------------------
In a great rush of excitement Harry dived downward after the streak of gold.
----------------------------------------------
“What are you looking for, boy?” “Nothing,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry understood what Harry had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.
----------------------------------------------
“You bowed to me once in a shop.” “Harry remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.
----------------------------------------------
A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at Harry once on a bus.
----------------------------------------------
Harry grunted and offered Harry another rock cake.
----------------------------------------------
Go on — out!” Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library.
----------------------------------------------
“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Harry.
----------------------------------------------
After asking Harry furiously if Harry knew A tiny man in a violet top hat, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to catch it, but Harry arms were too heavy.
----------------------------------------------
“Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” Harry leaned forward.
----------------------------------------------
Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with Harry head under Harry wing.
----------------------------------------------
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off Houses.
----------------------------------------------
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harryand Ron thought was very good for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up Harry steak.
----------------------------------------------
Good luck, all of you.” Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping Harry knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s head was swimming.
----------------------------------------------
Harry remembered Ron telling Harry on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts , but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.
----------------------------------------------
...” Yew shook Yew head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.
----------------------------------------------
I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.” “Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to remember it all.
----------------------------------------------
He’d really done something to be proud of now — no one could say Harry was just a famous name any more.
----------------------------------------------
Harry — heard hooves behind Harry —, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at a hooded figure.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry moved aside, Dumbledore felt the Stone against Dumbledore leg.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
----------------------------------------------
“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what Harry wanted before they could hurry Harry away, they bought Harry a cheap lemon ice pop.
----------------------------------------------
Harry glided toward he heard voices and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.
----------------------------------------------
Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.” Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at Snape again.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother Harry , fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of Harry four-poster.
----------------------------------------------
but — Harry suddenly jumped to Harry feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s ear narrowed Harry’s ear wicked black eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
“Mom?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry said nothing.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione slipped back down the spiral staircase, Harry and Hermione hearts as light as Harry and Hermione hands, now that Norbert was off Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
a drag — ” Harry was staring at a drag — ” Harry slippers, as still as a statue.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told Harry to go and make a cup of tea.
----------------------------------------------
bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in postage stamps at all.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.” “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.
----------------------------------------------
’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever Harry wanted at Harry lightest touch.
----------------------------------------------
“If we just do a bit of poking around — ” “No,” said Harry flatly, ““’ve done enough poking around.” Harry pulled a map of Jupiter toward Harry and started to learn the names of moons.
----------------------------------------------
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled the door open and Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron ran inside.
----------------------------------------------
Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, Harry and the Weasleys returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in Harry new chess set by losing spectacularly to RonRon.
----------------------------------------------
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to go to the end- of-year feast,” Harry told Madam Pomfrey as Madam Pomfrey straightened Harry many candy boxes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.
----------------------------------------------
Harrywas just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped this large parcel right in front of Harry, knocking Harry bacon to the third floor.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t be silly, Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon hates a large blond boy.” the Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though Harry wasn’t there — or rather, as though Harry was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had a funny feeling Harry’d had the same dream before.
----------------------------------------------
It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.” Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry Harry eyes on the sheet.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” Harry unfolded a second piece of paper Harry hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: .
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second Harry was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in Harry ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — Harry stretched out Harry hand — a foot from the ground Harry caught a foot, just in time to pull his broom straight, and Harry toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in Harry fist.
----------------------------------------------
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop.
----------------------------------------------
Harry picked a bill up and stared at a bill, Harry heart twanging like a giant elastic band.
----------------------------------------------
“Right, stand back, Harry.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind tapped the wall above the trash can three times with the point of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind umbrella.
----------------------------------------------
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?” “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto Harry broomstick and taken off.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” As the largest snake in the place shook the largest snake in the place head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of a deafening shout behind Harry jump.
----------------------------------------------
“Mind you, We did save Neville .” “Neville might not have needed saving if We hadn’t locked the thing in with Neville ,” Harry reminded Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Looking down at Harry legs, Harry saw only moonlight and shadows.
----------------------------------------------
On the last day of August Harry thought Harry’d better speak to Harry aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so Harry went down to the living room where his aunt and uncle were watching a quiz show on television.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show Hagrid couldn’t come in.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone thinks I’m special,” Harry said at last.
----------------------------------------------
“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” Harry swung round.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry needed to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy to forget.
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
----------------------------------------------
It was indeed as though ice was flooding Harry body.
----------------------------------------------
we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s’s second bedroom.” “Why?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” “Er — no,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than Harry asking questions, it was Harry talking about anything acting in a way the Dursleys shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think Harry might get dangerous ideas.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone stared as Harry reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” Harry then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
----------------------------------------------
This reminded Harry of something.
----------------------------------------------
The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for humans.” Harry lay there, lost for words.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s a broomstick,” That’s a broomstick said, throwing the package from Harry back to Harry Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
What’s that dog guarding?” Harry went to bed with Harry head buzzing with the same question.
----------------------------------------------
Potatoes, Harry?” Harry’s mouth fell open.
----------------------------------------------
“White always plays first in chess,” said Harry, peering across the board.
----------------------------------------------
Setting a lamp down carefully on the floor, Harry looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’sand Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.
----------------------------------------------
Catching the look on Harry’s face, Harry added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.
----------------------------------------------
“Dad, Mrs. Figg’s got something!” Harry was on the point of unfolding Harry letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of Harry hand by Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Neville held up Percy hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Back, Fang.” Harry let Back, Fang.” in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.
----------------------------------------------
The only thing Harry liked about Harry own appearance was a very thin scar on Harry forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you,” Uncle Vernon had said, putting Uncle Vernon large purple face right up close to his money’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Ron sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though Ron had suddenly realized what Ron was doing, Ron looked quickly out of the window again.
----------------------------------------------
the ghost in the ruff patted the ghost in the ruff arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling the ghost in the ruff ’d just plunged his arm into a bucket of ice-cold water.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry remembered: “Sir!
----------------------------------------------
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped the compartment onto an empty seat.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid , like RonRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Professor Snapeliked hardly any of the students.
----------------------------------------------
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
----------------------------------------------
“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep Wood a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
----------------------------------------------
Harry nervously tried to flatten Harry hair.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie Weasley’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Harry Potter’s , we owe you one!” Only Ron stood by Only Ron.
----------------------------------------------
He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when Harry’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that Harry’d somehow turned Harry teachers wig blue.
----------------------------------------------
Breathing very fast, Harry turned slowly back to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
Not wanting to miss anything, Harry got some of everything and paid a smiling, dimpled woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted Harry and Hermione off the path behind a towering oak.
----------------------------------------------
Harry crossed Harry fingers under the table and a second later a pointed wizard’s hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into a large gold chair next to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor Harry could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
----------------------------------------------
Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic solutions to Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” At this moment The boat Uncle Vernon had hired bumped gently into the harbor wall.
----------------------------------------------
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt Harry if Dumbledore gently was watching.
----------------------------------------------
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).
----------------------------------------------
I don’t think I’ve introduced Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Just take it and give it a wave.” Harry took wand and (feeling foolish) waved wand around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched wand out of Mr. Ollivander hand almost at once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry finally left the table, Harry was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- Your-Own-Warts kit, and Harry own new wizard chess set.
----------------------------------------------
Meant ter turn Hagrid into a pig, but I suppose Hagrid was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” Hagrid cast a sideways look at Harry under Hagrid bushy eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
No one seemed to have noticed that His broom was behaving strangely His broom was carrying Harry slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as His broom went.
----------------------------------------------
Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, Privet Drive — ’ ” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
At first Harry, who had expected more marble just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.
----------------------------------------------
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” Harry felt the blood drain out of Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.
----------------------------------------------
As for Harry and Harry, Harry and Ron legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without Harry and Ron noticing.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.” Harry wished Harry had about eight more eyes.
----------------------------------------------
All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.” “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked even smaller and skinnier than Harry really was because all Harry had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley’s was about four times bigger than Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how Harry had managed to get through Harry exams when Harry half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
“ Potter , did Anne” say?” “ “ Potter?” The last thing Harry saw before a pointed wizard’s hat dropped over Harry eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal no one, no one’s too well protected.” “But Professor — ” “Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” Professor McGonagall said shortly.
----------------------------------------------
“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “So proud, Harry Potter ..., I’m just so proud.” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in Harry excitement.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
“ Harry Potter,” chorused the red-haired twins .
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t allowed Harry Potter.” Ron couldn’t resist it.
----------------------------------------------
Come to think of it, Potter wasn’t even sure Potter nephew was called Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” My father said slowly.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Potter found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when Potter left the building at five o’clock, Potter was still so worried that Potter walked straight into someone just outside the door.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, “Harry Potter?” Harry forced Harry to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost their all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
----------------------------------------------
Potter Room Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for a letter but Uncle Vernonknocked Uncle Vernon hand out of the way.

“For your information, “Harry Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful a sleeping potion is known as the Draught of Living Death.
----------------------------------------------
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that Lily and James Potter are —’re — dead.” Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Harry Potter’s , we owe you one!” Only Ron stood by Only Ron.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it would go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
----------------------------------------------
“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — Snape — ” “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and Quirrell wasn’t Quirrell usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.

One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was special, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as Mrs. Dursley opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared at Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes — Potter — come here.” — Potter — clapped — Potter — hands once, and the ropes around his ankles fell off.
----------------------------------------------
I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.
----------------------------------------------
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Then my dratted sister met that Potter at school and my mother and father left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, my dratted sister went and got my dratted sister blown up and we got landed with my dratted sister!” Deputy Headmistress Potter at school had gone very white.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Out of the corner of Harry eye Harry saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.
----------------------------------------------
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.

Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, Privet Drive — ’ ” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry.

Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.

Muggle
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Well, Gran brought me up and Mom’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages.
----------------------------------------------
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled People as People moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
----------------------------------------------
“But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” “Do they?
----------------------------------------------
They reminded Harrythe little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that They were fifty feet high.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find out how to curse even Dudley.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into Yeh beard.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as Muggle called it, gave the bills to Harry so Muggle could buy Hagrid, who didn’t tickets.
----------------------------------------------
These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with These fantastic party favors little plastic toys and These fantastic party favors flimsy paper hats inside.
----------------------------------------------
Anyway, what does Yer not from a Muggle family know about the Leaky Cauldron, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum!
----------------------------------------------
People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.” She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Albus Dumbledore here, as though hoping Albus Dumbledore was going to tell She something, but Albus Dumbledore didn’t, so She went on.
----------------------------------------------
It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” “School Houses.
----------------------------------------------
There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
----------------------------------------------
We’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.” “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though Professor McGonagall didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Dursleys
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than Harry asking questions, it was Harry talking about anything acting in a way the Dursleys shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think Harry might get dangerous ideas.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley’s and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on the animals favorite hobby of hitting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys had received a very angry letter from his money’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.
----------------------------------------------
If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side!
----------------------------------------------
If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, Harry hadmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told Harry so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
the Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what Harry wanted before they could hurry Harry away, they bought Harry a cheap lemon ice pop.
----------------------------------------------
The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and The problem was just no good telling the Dursleys Harry didn’t make the Dursleys happen.
----------------------------------------------
Of course, Uncle Vernon birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given Uncle Vernon a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old socks.
----------------------------------------------
Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?
----------------------------------------------
The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; The sun crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as The sun had been on the night when Mrs. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.
----------------------------------------------
You told me they died in a car crash!” “CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to they corner.
----------------------------------------------
He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when Harry’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that Harry’d somehow turned Harry teachers wig blue.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.

These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with These fantastic party favors little plastic toys and These fantastic party favors flimsy paper hats inside.
----------------------------------------------
It was on they news.” a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes jerked a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window.
----------------------------------------------
Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.
----------------------------------------------
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t be silly, Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon hates a large blond boy.” the Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though Harry wasn’t there — or rather, as though Harry was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as Harry could remember, ever since Harry’d been a baby and Harry parents had died in that car crash.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that Harry had pockets rattling with gold and silver Harry was ready to buy Mars Bars as Harry could carry — but a smiling, dimpled woman didn’t have Mars Bars.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------

Albus Dumbledore
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore was beaming at the students, Albus Dumbledore arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased Albus Dumbledore more than to see them all there.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore clicked The nearest street lamp again — the next lamp flickered into darkness.
----------------------------------------------
Instead Albus Dumbledore was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat on the wall outside had had around the cat on the wall outside eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s bringing Albus Dumbledore.” “You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Albus Dumbledore was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad.
----------------------------------------------
These people will never understand Albus Dumbledore!
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be here, by the way?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Albus Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that Harry was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
About what finally stopped he?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall did now.
----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore was busy rummaging in Albus Dumbledore cloak, looking for something.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore clicked the silver Put- Outer once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and Albus Dumbledore could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
----------------------------------------------
“Good luck, Harry,” Albus Dumbledore murmured.
----------------------------------------------
It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true.
----------------------------------------------
“Hell have that scar forever.” “Couldn’t you do something about it, Albus Dumbledore?” “Even if I could, I wouldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry astonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.
----------------------------------------------
“Really, Albus Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?
----------------------------------------------
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that Lily and James Potter are —’re — dead.” Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to Albus Dumbledore feet.
----------------------------------------------
“his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to Albus Dumbledore when Albus Dumbledore’s older.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that Albus Dumbledore had just arrived in a street where everything from Albus Dumbledore name to Albus Dumbledore boots was unwelcome.
----------------------------------------------
Twelve times Albus Dumbledore clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Weird).” Harry stared as Albus Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on Harry card and gave Harry a small smile.
----------------------------------------------
of all the things to stop Albus Dumbledore .
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.” Albus Dumbledore found what Albus Dumbledore was looking for in Albus Dumbledore inside pocket.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone knows you’re the only one You- Know- oh, all right, Voldemort , was frightened of.” “You flatter me,” said Albus Dumbledore calmly.
----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above Albus Dumbledore swam.
----------------------------------------------
People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.” She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Albus Dumbledore here, as though hoping Albus Dumbledore was going to tell She something, but Albus Dumbledore didn’t, so She went on.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore gave a great sniff as Albus Dumbledore took a golden watch from Albus Dumbledore pocket and examined a golden watch from his pocket.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledoregone!” “Well, you can’t expect Albus Dumbledore to hang around all day,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore slipped the Put- Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where Albus Dumbledore sat down on the wall next to the cat on the wall outside.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

Dumbledore
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore ticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course.
----------------------------------------------
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore was beaming at the students, Albus Dumbledore arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased Albus Dumbledore more than to see them all there.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore sat down next to Harry, took one look at Dumbledore, and burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
Instead Albus Dumbledore was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat on the wall outside had had around the cat on the wall outside eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s bringing Albus Dumbledore.” “You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Can I ask you something?” “Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore gently smiled.
----------------------------------------------
With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you.
----------------------------------------------
It was the only thing Dumbledore didn’t know, an’ I told Dumbledore!
----------------------------------------------
I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be here, by the way?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
And then, Dumbledore did something Snape could never forgive.” “What?” “Snape saved Snape life.” “What?” “Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore was busy rummaging in Albus Dumbledore cloak, looking for something.
----------------------------------------------
It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry astonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.
----------------------------------------------
Young Sirius Black fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.
----------------------------------------------
They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did They know anyone who had been sent to see Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to Albus Dumbledore when Albus Dumbledore’s older.
----------------------------------------------
Twelve times Albus Dumbledore clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
’Course, Dumbledore shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got y eh this ...” this seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book.
----------------------------------------------
“Weird).” Harry stared as Albus Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on Harry card and gave Harry a small smile.
----------------------------------------------
HarryHarry, relax, Hermione ’s right, The unicorn’s dead safe as long as Dumbledore’s around.
----------------------------------------------
G ’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Wiping Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” streaming eyes on Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” jacket sleeve, Hagridswung Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar the engine rose into the air and off into the night.
----------------------------------------------
It’s not exactly a secret we hate Snape, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it up to get Dumbledore sacked.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore gave a great sniff as Albus Dumbledore took a golden watch from Albus Dumbledore pocket and examined a golden watch from his pocket.
----------------------------------------------
“Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this .
----------------------------------------------
“Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore clicked The nearest street lamp again — the next lamp flickered into darkness.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped Dumbledore pointed wizardRon’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read Professor Flitwick.
----------------------------------------------
I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore watching.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, music,” Professor Dumbledore said, wiping Professor Dumbledore eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Albus Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that Harry was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
About what finally stopped he?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall did now.
----------------------------------------------
As usual when Dumbledore was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read the name on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore gently is particularly famous for Dumbledore gently defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ Hermione jumped to Hermione .
----------------------------------------------
“Good luck, Harry,” Albus Dumbledore murmured.
----------------------------------------------
“They wanted DUMBLEDORE fer Minister, o’ course, but Dumbledore fer ’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.
----------------------------------------------
“I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met Dumbledore in the entrance hall — Dumbledore already knew — Dumbledore just said, ‘Harry’s gone after Harry, hasn’t Harry?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” “D’you think “D’you meant you to do “D’you?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Hell have that scar forever.” “Couldn’t you do something about it, Albus Dumbledore?” “Even if I could, I wouldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” “But that means Nicolas and Nicolas wife will die, won’t he and his wife?” “he and his wife have enough Elixir stored to set he and his wife affairs in order and then, yes, he and his wife will die.” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that Lily and James Potter are —’re — dead.” Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to Albus Dumbledore feet.
----------------------------------------------
But why would Lord Voldemort want to kill me in the first place?” Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
----------------------------------------------
“I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of Yeh, how much yeh didn’t know.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that Albus Dumbledore had just arrived in a street where everything from Albus Dumbledore name to Albus Dumbledore boots was unwelcome.
----------------------------------------------
But Dumbledore hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving Dumbledore lips.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
NICHOLAS FLAMBL Dumbledore gently had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays an Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of Dumbledore gently trunk.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
“Light — speedy — we’ll have to get Harry a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycould go to Dumbledore at any moment.” Hagrid bit Hagrid lip.
----------------------------------------------
I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep it safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew someone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
All this You- Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: Voldemort .” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry had found Harry voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent his voice to me?” “Ah — your father happened to leave his voice in my possession, and I thought you might like his voice.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.
----------------------------------------------
And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore clicked the silver Put- Outer once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and Albus Dumbledore could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
I told Dumbledore!
----------------------------------------------
“But your friend — Nicolas Flamel — ” “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.
----------------------------------------------
“We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help Dumbledore, apart from Dumbledore.” Hagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry moved aside, Dumbledore felt the Stone against Dumbledore leg.
----------------------------------------------
““D’you’s a funny man, Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s just going to die?” “That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it?
----------------------------------------------
Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.” Albus Dumbledore found what Albus Dumbledore was looking for in Albus Dumbledore inside pocket.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
So Dumbledore fer pelts DUMBLEDORE with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.” “But what does a Ministry of Magic Ministry of Magic Magic do?” “Well, their main job is to keep their main job from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.” “Why?” “Why?
----------------------------------------------
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for Dumbledore, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at Harry scar.
----------------------------------------------
Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Quirrellgot to Professor Dumbledore again.
----------------------------------------------
The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above Albus Dumbledore swam.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.” The goblin read a letter here from Professor Dumbledore carefully.
----------------------------------------------
And where did you get a huge motorcycle?” “Borrowed a huge motorcycle, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said a huge motorcycle, climbing carefully off a huge motorcycle as he spoke.
----------------------------------------------
“ Fluffy ?” “Yeah — bought off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent to Dumbledore to guard the — ” “Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.” She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Albus Dumbledore here, as though hoping Albus Dumbledore was going to tell She something, but Albus Dumbledore didn’t, so She went on.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got to talk to Dumbledore.” Professor McGonagall eyed Dumbledore with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledoregone!” “Well, you can’t expect Albus Dumbledore to hang around all day,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.” Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry Harry eyes on the sheet.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore slipped the Put- Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where Albus Dumbledore sat down on the wall next to the cat on the wall outside.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
“See Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Albus Dumbledore was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone stared as Harry reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” Harry then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore gave Professor Dumbledore wand a little flick, as if Professor Dumbledore was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of he was , which rose high above the tables and twisted he was , snakelike, into words.
----------------------------------------------
I do think he’s the Slytherin ghost might have told us prefects, at least.” “And now, before us go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
These people will never understand Albus Dumbledore!
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore gently stared at the back of the card.
----------------------------------------------
“That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out Hagrid chest.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
An’ you’ve kept fer him from Dumbledore all these years?” “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
“Really, Albus Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve found him\” Dumbledore gently whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“I know Harry’s not very nice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
----------------------------------------------
I see Dumbledore gently holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt Harry if Dumbledore gently was watching.
----------------------------------------------
probably knew they were too close ter Reckon Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.
----------------------------------------------
of all the things to stop Albus Dumbledore .
----------------------------------------------
“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” Dumbledore sobbed, Dumbledore face in Dumbledore hands.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone knows you’re the only one You- Know- oh, all right, Voldemort , was frightened of.” “You flatter me,” said Albus Dumbledore calmly.
----------------------------------------------
Never told A braver man than Vernon Dursley what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him?
----------------------------------------------
Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing They in the right direction.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Professor McGonagall
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall opened the door and poked Professor McGonagall head inside.
----------------------------------------------
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” Hermione had managed to get to his feet at last.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal no one, no one’s too well protected.” “But Professor — ” “Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” Professor McGonagall said shortly.
----------------------------------------------
...” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over Professor McGonagall glasses at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore ticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course.
----------------------------------------------
“What they’re saying,” Professor McGonagall pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind the other students.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall blew Professor McGonagall nose in reply.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
When Professor McGonagallappeared, Professor McGonagall was leading Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“See Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
----------------------------------------------
The books Professor McGonagall was carrying tumbled out of Professor McGonagall arms, but Professor McGonagall didn’t pick The books she was carrying up.
----------------------------------------------
“How do you know — ?” Professor McGonagall spluttered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood .
----------------------------------------------
We’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.” “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though Professor McGonagall didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops.
----------------------------------------------
“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be here, by the way?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
All this You- Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: Voldemort .” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
----------------------------------------------
About what finally stopped he?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall did now.
----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall explained.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.
----------------------------------------------
“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in Professor voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall watched they turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if the snuffbox had whiskers.
----------------------------------------------
“In here.” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall pointed they into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
Young Sirius Black fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
Then something happened that made Professor McGonagall jump about a foot in the air — several people behind Professor McGonagall screamed.
----------------------------------------------
Filch took Things down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor, where Things sat and waited without saying a word to each other.
----------------------------------------------
“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?” Professor McGonagall opened Professor McGonagall mouth, changed Professor McGonagall mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course.
----------------------------------------------
There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes.
----------------------------------------------
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying sir face in Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
So did the people around Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind Professor McGonagall and turned to face the two boys.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” Professor McGonagall stormed.
----------------------------------------------
“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid’s.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps Professor McGonagall could be Hermione Granger’s assistant.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall lips were white.
----------------------------------------------
“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort ’s name.” “I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at Professor McGonagall; Professor McGonagall had to jog to keep up.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall stomach twisted as Professor McGonagall imagined it, watching Ronand the others becoming wizards while Professor McGonagall stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.
----------------------------------------------
It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” The sky had turned light before they stopped talking.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.
----------------------------------------------
“Your father would have been proud,” Professor McGonagall said.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s — It’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“We may never know.” Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at Professor McGonagall eyes beneath Professor McGonagall spectacles.
----------------------------------------------
G ’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Wiping Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” streaming eyes on Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” jacket sleeve, Hagridswung Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar the engine rose into the air and off into the night.
----------------------------------------------
“What are you three doing inside?” It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had just finished telling Ronwhat had happened when Harry’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got to talk to Dumbledore.” Professor McGonagall eyed Dumbledore with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall bent down and gathered up the fallen books.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall got to Professor McGonagall feet, trembling.
----------------------------------------------
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane Professor McGonagall was going to use on Harry?
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Professor
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” Hermione had managed to get to his feet at last.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal no one, no one’s too well protected.” “But Professor — ” “Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” Professor McGonagall said shortly.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns was head of Gryffindor House, but Professor Binns hadn’t stopped Professor Binns from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
----------------------------------------------
They say Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore ticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off The entrance hall.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood .
----------------------------------------------
“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be here, by the way?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that Professor Flitwick thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen Professor Flitwick make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk.
----------------------------------------------
It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true.
----------------------------------------------
Young Sirius Black fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape opened a small package from his grandmother excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” Professor McGonagall stormed.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Higgs — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” the Slytherins were cheering.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall lips were white.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at Professor McGonagall; Professor McGonagall had to jog to keep up.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
“We may never know.” Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at Professor McGonagall eyes beneath Professor McGonagall spectacles.
----------------------------------------------
G ’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Wiping Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” streaming eyes on Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” jacket sleeve, Hagridswung Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar the engine rose into the air and off into the night.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Flitwick told me all about the special circumstances, Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
The books Professor McGonagall was carrying tumbled out of Professor McGonagall arms, but Professor McGonagall didn’t pick The books she was carrying up.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns had been very old indeed when Professor Binns had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving Professor Binns body behind Professor Binns.
----------------------------------------------
Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped Dumbledore pointed wizardRon’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read Professor Flitwick.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, music,” Professor Dumbledore said, wiping Professor Dumbledore eyes.
----------------------------------------------
About what finally stopped he?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall did now.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
What if Harry just sat there with the hat over Harry eyes for ages, until Professor jerked it off Harry head and said there had obviously been a mistake and Harry’d better get back on the train?
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in Professor voice.
----------------------------------------------
I do believe Professor Snape worked so hard to protect you this year because Professor Snape felt that would make Professor Snape and your father even.
----------------------------------------------
When the ghost of Professor Binns told they to put down they quills and roll up they parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
A barn owl brought Professor Snape a small package from Professor Snape grandmother.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
Then something happened that made Professor McGonagall jump about a foot in the air — several people behind Professor McGonagall screamed.
----------------------------------------------
Filch took Things down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor, where Things sat and waited without saying a word to each other.
----------------------------------------------
“And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind Professor McGonagall and turned to face the two boys.
----------------------------------------------
“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid’s.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps Professor McGonagall could be Hermione Granger’s assistant.
----------------------------------------------
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Professor Flitwick’s class looking confused.
----------------------------------------------
“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort ’s name.” “I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had just finished telling Ronwhat had happened when Harry’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had been quite right to think Professor Binns wasn’t a teacher to cross.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall bent down and gathered up the fallen books.
----------------------------------------------
“Light — speedy — we’ll have to get Harry a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
two across ...” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind muttered.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” Professor Snape whimpered as boils started to pop up all over Professor Snape nose.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“In here.” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall pointed they into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
----------------------------------------------
...” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over Professor McGonagall glasses at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.
----------------------------------------------
When Professor McGonagallappeared, Professor McGonagall was leading Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall blew Professor McGonagall nose in reply.
----------------------------------------------
“How do you know — ?” Professor McGonagall spluttered.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Quirrell took one look at even a troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Quirrell, in Professor Quirrell absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
----------------------------------------------
Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you — ” “You don’t understand, Professor.
----------------------------------------------
Scared of the students, scared of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?” Vampires?
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
All this You- Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: Voldemort .” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at HALLOWEEN Malfoy’s elbow.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
----------------------------------------------
“a small package from his grandmother’s the Remembrall!” Professor Snape explained.
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
“You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” Harry put on a high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong.
----------------------------------------------
“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?” Professor McGonagall opened Professor McGonagall mouth, changed Professor McGonagall mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course.
----------------------------------------------
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying sir face in Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
----------------------------------------------
But how is the boy getting here, Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.
----------------------------------------------
“Your father would have been proud,” Professor McGonagall said.
----------------------------------------------
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Quirrellgot to Professor Dumbledore again.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.” The goblin read a letter here from Professor Dumbledore carefully.
----------------------------------------------
And where did you get a huge motorcycle?” “Borrowed a huge motorcycle, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said a huge motorcycle, climbing carefully off a huge motorcycle as he spoke.
----------------------------------------------
“What are you three doing inside?” It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.
----------------------------------------------
The brick Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind had touched quivered — The brick he had touched wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — The brick he had touched grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got to talk to Dumbledore.” Professor McGonagall eyed Dumbledore with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
----------------------------------------------
he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but warmth caught every word — like Professor Binns, Professor Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
----------------------------------------------
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane Professor McGonagall was going to use on Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall opened the door and poked Professor McGonagall head inside.
----------------------------------------------
“Right, stand back, Harry.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind tapped the wall above the trash can three times with the point of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind umbrella.
----------------------------------------------
“See Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
----------------------------------------------
“What they’re saying,” Professor McGonagall pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind the other students.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone stared as Harry reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” Harry then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore gave Professor Dumbledore wand a little flick, as if Professor Dumbledore was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of he was , which rose high above the tables and twisted he was , snakelike, into words.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
I do think he’s the Slytherin ghost might have told us prefects, at least.” “And now, before us go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
We’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.” “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though Professor McGonagall didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.
----------------------------------------------
Look, you hold it tight like this and if this turns red — oh ...” Professor Snape face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “...
----------------------------------------------
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall explained.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
“That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out Hagrid chest.
----------------------------------------------
“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall watched they turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if the snuffbox had whiskers.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid , like RonRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Professor Snapeliked hardly any of the students.
----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Flitwicktold me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on Professor Flitwick exam.
----------------------------------------------
There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes.
----------------------------------------------
So did the people around Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as white as Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” The sky had turned light before they stopped talking.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall stomach twisted as Professor McGonagall imagined it, watching Ronand the others becoming wizards while Professor McGonagall stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s — It’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” Harry felt the blood drain out of Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall got to Professor McGonagall feet, trembling.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Voldemort
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Banethinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.
----------------------------------------------
last night Voldemort went to find the Potters.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t even Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
“What they’re saying,” Professor McGonagall pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow.
----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was.
----------------------------------------------
When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, Lord Voldemort was most displeased.
----------------------------------------------
Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” Voldemort glared at my parents.
----------------------------------------------
Since then, I have served Lord Voldemort faithfully, although I have let Lord Voldemort down many times.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only hear Harry’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort didn’t realize that love as powerful as my mother ’s for you leaves that love as powerful as your mother’s for you own mark.
----------------------------------------------
Tried to frighten me — as though Snape could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, this is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, Yeh’d have found out even if you hadn’t told Yeh.” “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
All this You- Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: Voldemort .” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
----------------------------------------------
decided Lord Voldemort would have to keep a closer watch on me.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side!
----------------------------------------------
“Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of Voldemort certainly scared The idea of Voldemort, but The idea of Voldemort didn’t keep visiting The idea of Voldemort in dreams, and The idea of Voldemort were so busy with The idea of Voldemort studying The idea of Voldemort didn’t have much time to fret about what “Snape or anyone else might be up to.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
Sir — even if Harry’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” “Call Sir Voldemort, Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ...
----------------------------------------------
“Voldemort had powers I will never have.” “Only because you’re too — well — noble to use Only because you’re too.” “It’s lucky It’s dark.
----------------------------------------------
But why would Lord Voldemort want to kill me in the first place?” Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
----------------------------------------------
“Lord Voldemort does not forgive mistakes easily.
----------------------------------------------
“Then kill Harry, fool, and be done!” screeched Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of Voldemort very last exam was History of Magic.
----------------------------------------------
If there is one thing Lord Voldemort cannot understand, it is love.
----------------------------------------------
and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort — ” Ron gasped.
----------------------------------------------
“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort ’s name.” “I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.
----------------------------------------------
the mirror’s almost like “D’you thought I had the right to face Lord Voldemort if I could.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort punished me .
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing Quirrell soul with Lord Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason.
----------------------------------------------
Harry supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but this had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was walking backward at Harry, so that Voldemort could still see Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort said that Lord Voldemort only killed my mother because my mother tried to stop Lord Voldemort from killing me.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone knows you’re the only one You- Know- oh, all right, Voldemort , was frightened of.” “You flatter me,” said Albus Dumbledore calmly.
----------------------------------------------
All right — Voldemort.” Hagridshuddered.
----------------------------------------------
...” “Stop saying the name!” said Harry in a terrified whisper, as if Harry thought Voldemort could hear them.
----------------------------------------------
If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back!
----------------------------------------------
“An’ don’ say the name!” “VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, Harry stopped crying.
----------------------------------------------
Now give me the Stone, unless you want your mother to have died in vain.” “NEVER!” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist.
----------------------------------------------
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how Harry had managed to get through Harry exams when Harry half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment.
----------------------------------------------
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Madam Pomfrey
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey Malfoy wanted to borrow one of my books so Malfoy could come and have a good laugh at Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says Snape’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!
----------------------------------------------
I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
----------------------------------------------
“I want to go to the end- of-year feast,” Harry told Madam Pomfrey as Madam Pomfrey straightened Harry many candy boxes.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.” “How long have I been in here?” “Three days.
----------------------------------------------
“Harryl” Hermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” again, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry head was still very sore.
----------------------------------------------
the Great Hall was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Madam Pomfrey’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.
----------------------------------------------
Sir, I — ” Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.” Harry swallowed and looked around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Harry Potter
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “So proud, Harry Potter ..., I’m just so proud.” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in Harry excitement.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
“ Harry Potter,” chorused the red-haired twins .
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t allowed Harry Potter.” Ron couldn’t resist it.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, “Harry Potter?” Harry forced Harry to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
----------------------------------------------
No one knows why, or how, but Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly.
----------------------------------------------
“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost their all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
----------------------------------------------
“For your information, “Harry Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful a sleeping potion is known as the Draught of Living Death.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Harry Potter’s , we owe you one!” Only Ron stood by Only Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it would go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
----------------------------------------------
One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was special, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as Mrs. Dursley opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin Dudley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry stared at Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Professor Flitwick told me all about the special circumstances, Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter ...” face Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Hagrid
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, “That’s — er ...” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
----------------------------------------------
You there, still got yer toad?” Hagrid’s raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on front door.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ go shoutin’ about shoutin, what’s the matter with yeh?” “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” “SHHHH!” said Hagrid again.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under Hagrid pillow.
----------------------------------------------
There was somethin’ goin’ on that night Don hadn’t counted on — / dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped Don, all right.” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in Hagrid eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s bringing Albus Dumbledore.” “You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a centaur.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid greeted Ron, and Hermione, looking flushed and excited.
----------------------------------------------
yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran Hagridfingers through Yeh hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
----------------------------------------------
“Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at Fang heel.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
Had Hagrid collected that grubby little package just in time?
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and ’s going to be as long as your house.
----------------------------------------------
Then Hagrid voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry pulled the door open.
----------------------------------------------
At last, Hagrid managed to make Hagrid heard over the babble.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” Hagrid leaned across the table.
----------------------------------------------
So I told it ter, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm yeh down, jus’ play yeh a bit o’ music an’ yeh’ll go straight off ter sleep — ” Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, you listen here, boy,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, your parents were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without your parents in my opinion — asked for all your parents got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew your parents’d come to a sticky end — ” But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside Hagrid coat.
----------------------------------------------
“D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave Hagrid anything?” “But if their house was destroyed — ” “their didntheir keep their gold in their house, boy!
----------------------------------------------
“Bin watchin’ from “Bin hut,” said Hagrid , patting a large pair of binoculars around Hagrid neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid usually gets me ter do important stuff fer Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, The unicorn’s dead’s in that clearing back there.” “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn.
----------------------------------------------
“Unusually bright.” “Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw Snape!” “I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid , raising Hagrid binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I found out something about Harry,” Harry told Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from — knows Hagrid can trust me, see.
----------------------------------------------
They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled Harry back by the scruff of Harry neck.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over Hagrid shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” There was a loud “Oooooh!” The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake.
----------------------------------------------
“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding Hagrid newspaper as Hagrid spoke.
----------------------------------------------
And did Hagrid know something about Snape that Snape didn’t want to tell Harry?
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think it had anything to do with the Sorcerer’s Stone?” “I’m going to see what section Hagrid was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough of working.
----------------------------------------------
Over the rustling of the trees, Harry seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told Harry on the night they had met: “Some say Harry died.
----------------------------------------------
I will take Hagrid’s from here.” A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes pulled front door wide.
----------------------------------------------
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station.
----------------------------------------------
...” Hagrid wiped Hagrid nose on the back of Hagrid hand and said, “That reminds me.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry and Ron walked back to the main castle for dinner, Harry and Ron pockets weighed down with rock cakes Harry and Ron ’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given Harry as much to think about as tea with Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?” At five to three five to three left the main castle and made five to three way across the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
What are you doing in the library?” Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind Ron back.
----------------------------------------------
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
----------------------------------------------
the top parcel was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across the top parcel was To Harry, from Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Maybe Snapefound out how to get past Snape without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding asking Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid picked a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor up and tucked a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor deep inside Hagrid coat.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as Muggle called it, gave the bills to Harry so Muggle could buy Hagrid, who didn’t tickets.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something a boy with a pale didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
they stepped through an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
An old man was standing before them, Hagrid wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of The last shop.
----------------------------------------------
“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of a small cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in Stalagmite’s,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest.
----------------------------------------------
You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” Both Harry and Ron stood up.
----------------------------------------------
It might’ve been happening while we were there!” There was no doubt about It, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
As usual when Dumbledore was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid ’s was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping Hagrid ’s claw on the window, a newspaper held in Hagrid ’s beak.
----------------------------------------------
“Urn — Hagrid?” “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on Harry huge boots.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could mention this, Hagrid had steered Harry inside.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve decided to call The baby dragon Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at The baby dragon with misty eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside Hagrid house; Hagrid trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and Hagrid was shelling peas into a large bowl.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was so huge that Hagrid parted the crowd easily; Harry Harry had to do was keep close behind Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------
“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find out how to curse even Dudley.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
At last, Ronan said, “The forest hides many secrets.” A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagridraise Hagrid bow again, but Hagrid was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read Harry newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while people did this, but it was very difficult, Harry’d never had so many questions in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid’s.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was cursing your broomstick, muttering, Ron wouldn’t take his eyes off Ron.” “Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to Ron in the stands.
----------------------------------------------
“And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a the Sorcerer’s Stone’s St — ” “Shhhh\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
----------------------------------------------
and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort — ” Ron gasped.
----------------------------------------------
Behind the wild beard and eyebrows Hagrid wore a very kind smile.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell Harry something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid relief must have showed in Hagrid face, because Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?
----------------------------------------------
At the end nearest the ghost in the ruff sat Hagrid, who caught the ghost in the ruff eye and gave the ghost in the ruff the thumbs up.
----------------------------------------------
As Hagrid’s story came to a close, No one saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than No one had ever remembered it before — and No one remembered something else, for the first time in No one life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, are you all right?” Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking Ron head through the branches.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was watching Hagrid sadly.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.” did look very green, and when a small cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagridgot out and had to lean against the passage wall to stop Hagrid knees from trembling.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, how many times in our lives are our going to see a dragon hatching?” “our’ve got lessons, our’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone finds out what someone ’s doing — ” “Shut up!” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
his anger faded from Hagrid face.
----------------------------------------------
“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered.
----------------------------------------------
So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out Hagrid was hiding an illegal dragon in Hagrid hut.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ don’ say the name!” “VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, Harry stopped crying.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid asked what I did, an’ I told Hagrid I was gamekeeper here.
----------------------------------------------
Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think?
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked Hagrid beard.
----------------------------------------------
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly.
----------------------------------------------
Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, Harry kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycould go to Dumbledore at any moment.” Hagrid bit Hagrid lip.
----------------------------------------------
Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as walked up the white stone steps toward Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
It was a very dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid pulled out an arrow and fitted an arrow into Hagrid crossbow, raising an arrow, ready to fire.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?” “I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
----------------------------------------------
I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into Yeh beard.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione very nervous spent most of Ron, and Hermione very nervous free time in Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with Hagrid ’s.
----------------------------------------------
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told Two enormous feet that Hagrid was behind Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“we must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find Nicolas Flamel anywhere — just give we a hint — I know I’ve read Nicolas Flamel name somewhere.” “I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly.
----------------------------------------------
“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.
----------------------------------------------
Ahead, Harrycould see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut.
----------------------------------------------
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” Harry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, this is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, Yeh’d have found out even if you hadn’t told Yeh.” “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
All right there, Harry?” Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
----------------------------------------------
I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit.
----------------------------------------------
the unicorns had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
...” Yew shook Yew head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
— with a person called — came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew Hagrid nose with a sound like a foghorn.
----------------------------------------------
“We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help Dumbledore, apart from Dumbledore.” Hagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s nearly out.” Hagrid ushered Ron, and Hermione inside.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
----------------------------------------------
You told me they died in a car crash!” “CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to they corner.
----------------------------------------------
After a few minutes It’s stammered, “What does it mean, they await your owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to Hagrid forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside Hagrid overcoat Hagrid pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until Harry was out of sight; Harry rose in Harry seat and pressed Harry nose against the window, but Harry blinked and Hagrid had gone.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and Hagrid got quickly off the spindly chair.
----------------------------------------------
so I told Hagrid ...
----------------------------------------------
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying sir face in Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before Harry get ter that level.” Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.
----------------------------------------------
“Where was I?” said Hagrid Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
----------------------------------------------
Come on, Harry.” Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid called “Who is it?” before he let Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks in, and then shut the door quickly behind Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks.
----------------------------------------------
Look in the pockets.” Hagrid ’s ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ...
----------------------------------------------
You-Know-Who was one.” “Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all about Harry and Ron first lessons.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let Hagrid slip, because how else were Ron, going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?
----------------------------------------------
Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” Dudley said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
The brick Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind had touched quivered — The brick he had touched wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — The brick he had touched grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until Ron heard Ron say, “Hagrid!
----------------------------------------------
Anythin’ unusual?” Mars Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched Ronan impatiently.
----------------------------------------------
“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid’s as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent they all heads and the little boats carried they all through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” “Dunno said Hagrid casually, “Hagrid wouldn’ take Hagrid cloak off.” Hagrid saw the three of them look stunned and raised Hagrid eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
Then they all clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the great castle overhead.
----------------------------------------------
“Isn’t A couple of sparks beautiful?” Hagrid murmured.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show Hagrid couldn’t come in.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid works at Hogwarts.” “Oh,” said a boy with a pale, “I’ve heard of a boy with a pale.
----------------------------------------------
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to Harry so far.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered.
----------------------------------------------
“I liked Ron a lot — great with animals.” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid and Harrymade for a long counter.
----------------------------------------------
“Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, Hermione started looking frantically at the whole crowd.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which them refused.
----------------------------------------------
us kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks, to make Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks forget.” “So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid folded up Hagrid newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid pulled out his umbrella again, tapped Hagrid twice on the side of The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, and they sped off toward land.
----------------------------------------------
“That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out Hagrid chest.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk.
----------------------------------------------
If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, Harry hadmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told Harry so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting Harry.
----------------------------------------------
We think Harry was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.” Hagrid dropped the teapot.
----------------------------------------------
All right, Harry, Hermione?” “I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” , Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” ’re here to be punished, after all.” “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
----------------------------------------------
The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail could fly off again.
----------------------------------------------
I heard a boy with a pale’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then a boy with a pale gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to a boy with a pale bed.” “I think Hagrid’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of Yeh,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got ter .” They settled down in The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine Harry flying.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Firs’ years follow me!” Slipping and stumbling, ” Slipping and stumbling followed Hagrid’s down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid , like RonRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Professor Snapeliked hardly any of the students.
----------------------------------------------
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid came back a minute later with a pile of books in Hagrid arms and slammed them down on the table.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid ’s beard twitched and Hagrid ’s beard could tell Hagrid ’s beard was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from Hagrid face — Hagrid leapt to Hagrid feet and ran to the window.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given Harry for Christmas.
----------------------------------------------
“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, Ronan?
----------------------------------------------
For a famous place, Hagrid was very dark and shabby.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything Hagrid want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking Ron ears.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted Harry and Hermione off the path behind a towering oak.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling Hagrid feet.
----------------------------------------------
The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat.
----------------------------------------------
At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return.
----------------------------------------------
I forbid you to tell Yeh anything!” A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave A braver man than Vernon Dursley; when Hagrid spoke, A braver man than Vernon Dursley every syllable trembled with rage.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall stomach twisted as Professor McGonagall imagined it, watching Ronand the others becoming wizards while Professor McGonagall stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Meant ter turn Hagrid into a pig, but I suppose Hagrid was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” Hagrid cast a sideways look at Harry under Hagrid bushy eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
----------------------------------------------
“Dunno what Harry thinks Harry’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled.
----------------------------------------------
I don’t think I can be a wizard.” To Dudley surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
d’yeh like it?” Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.
----------------------------------------------
“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, here goes ...” Snape put Hagrid’s flute to Snape lips and blew.
----------------------------------------------
“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground?
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.” Harry wished Harry had about eight more eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell We, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------
“Budge up there, move along.” “Hagrid!” Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------

Philosophers Stone

----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Well, I say Your fatherfavored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.” Mr. Ollivander had come so close that the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia lips tightened as they always did if the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
There were no photographs of the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Aunt Petunia
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had had it as long as Harry could remember, and the first question Harry could ever remember asking His Aunt Petunia was how Harry had gotten it.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before Uncle Vernon collapsed into a chair, and His Aunt Petunia had to run and get Uncle Vernon a large brandy.
----------------------------------------------
After asking Harry furiously if Harry knew A tiny man in a violet top hat, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley’s on the moth-eaten sofa.
----------------------------------------------
While Dudley’s drove, Uncle Vernon complained to His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
The harder His Aunt Petunia tried to pull The over His Aunt Petunia head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Next morning, however, Dudley’s had gotten up to find his hair exactly as his hair had been before His Aunt Petunia had sheared his hair off.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia had been given a week in His Aunt Petunia cupboard for this, even though His Aunt Petunia had tried to explain that His Aunt Petunia couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly.
----------------------------------------------
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry to do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t speak to Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer His Aunt Petunia when His Aunt Petunia asked what Uncle Vernon’d bought.
----------------------------------------------
While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, His Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in His Aunt Petunia food processor.
----------------------------------------------
Atta boy, Dudley!” was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when His Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
----------------------------------------------
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to A tiny man in a violet top hat once while out shopping with His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s always sp- spoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with Dudley’s .
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor Harry could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
----------------------------------------------
Once, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair so short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had laughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was already laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
----------------------------------------------
When His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and Dudley arms over Aunt Petunia and Dudley faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
----------------------------------------------
Another time, His Aunt Petunia had been trying to force His Aunt Petunia into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls).
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia lips tightened as they always did if the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia heard Dudley’s banging things with Dudley’s Smelting stick all the way down the hall.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said His Aunt Petunia couldn’t believe it was His Aunt Petunia Ickle Dudleykins, His Aunt Petunia looked so handsome and grown-up.
----------------------------------------------
Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“And come back and find The whole house smelled of cabbage in ruins?” His Aunt Petunia snarled.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Uncle Vernon
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon roared.
----------------------------------------------
While Dudley’s drove, Uncle Vernon complained to His Aunt Petunia.
----------------------------------------------
Tell they us don’t want — ” Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with Dudley’s, but before His aunt and uncle’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
----------------------------------------------
“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” “Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer His Aunt Petunia when His Aunt Petunia asked what Uncle Vernon’d bought.
----------------------------------------------
While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, His Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in His Aunt Petunia food processor.
----------------------------------------------
“I want — ” Harry began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing three letters before Uncle Vernon eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, you listen here, boy,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, your parents were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without your parents in my opinion — asked for all your parents got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew your parents’d come to a sticky end — ” But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside Hagrid coat.
----------------------------------------------
the animals ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley’s had a tantrum because Dudley’s knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought Dudley’s another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
----------------------------------------------
“No post on Sundays,” Uncle Vernon reminded them cheerfully as Uncle Vernon spread marmalade on Uncle Vernon newspapers, “no damn letters today — ” Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as Something spoke and caught Something sharply on the back of the head.
----------------------------------------------
Potter Room Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for a letter but Uncle Vernonknocked Uncle Vernon hand out of the way.
----------------------------------------------
No one was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
----------------------------------------------
Didn’t us swear when us took — ” in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?” That evening when — ” got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something — ” ’d never done before; ’dvisited Harry in — ” cupboard.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city.
----------------------------------------------
OUT!Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw Harry into the hall.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagridstared wildly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before Uncle Vernon collapsed into a chair, and His Aunt Petunia had to run and get Uncle Vernon a large brandy.
----------------------------------------------
Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
After what seemed like hours their reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.
----------------------------------------------
“Haven’t I told you Uncle Vernon’s not going?” Uncle Vernon hissed.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s Monday,” Uncle Vernon told Uncle Vernon mother.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back Harry courage.
----------------------------------------------
After burning all the letters, Uncle Vernon got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harrywere just a few of Uncle Vernon favorite subjects.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s had been accepted at Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with Uncle Vernon knuckles, but the largest snake in the placejust snoozed on.
----------------------------------------------
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry to do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t speak to Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.
----------------------------------------------
Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s squeaked and ran to hide behind Dudley’s mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.
----------------------------------------------
Of course, Uncle Vernon birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given Uncle Vernon a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old socks.
----------------------------------------------
An’ An’’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” “we swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him!
----------------------------------------------
Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read Harry newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while people did this, but it was very difficult, Harry’d never had so many questions in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
As far as Harry had seen, the largest snake in the place hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at Piers and Dudley heels as the largest snake in the place passed, but by the time Piers and Dudley were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley’s was telling Piers and Dudley how the largest snake in the place had nearly bitten off Dudley’s leg, while Piers was swearing the largest snake in the place had tried to squeeze Dudley’s to death.
----------------------------------------------
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, Uncle Vernon said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word ...” In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; Uncle Vernon’s flattened Uncle Vernon’s against the wall and fell silent.
----------------------------------------------
Hogwarts’ll be with youngsters of Hogwarts own sort, fer a change, an’ Hogwarts’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled — ” “I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook Uncle Vernon head, got back in the car, and off them went again.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia heard Dudley’s banging things with Dudley’s Smelting stick all the way down the hall.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything Dudley’s gives you, Dudley’s.” A giant of a man chuckled darkly.
----------------------------------------------
•k k k On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.
----------------------------------------------
“Comb your hair!” Uncle Vernon barked, by way of a morning greeting.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
----------------------------------------------
The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Mrs. Figg’s new uniform.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following The woman from the dining room.
----------------------------------------------
“Where was I?” said Hagrid Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told Harry to go and make a cup of tea.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.
----------------------------------------------
When His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and Dudley arms over Aunt Petunia and Dudley faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
----------------------------------------------
After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in Harry hand.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what Harry’d been trying to do.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t be silly, Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon hates a large blond boy.” the Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though Harry wasn’t there — or rather, as though Harry was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
----------------------------------------------
“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and Uncle Vernon took both Harryand Dudley’s by the scruffs of both necks and threw both into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind both.
----------------------------------------------
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as Uncle Vernon worked, and jumped at small noises.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place could have wrapped the largest snake in the place body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed its body into a trash can — but at the moment its body didn’t look in the mood.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid pulled out his umbrella again, tapped Hagrid twice on the side of The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, and they sped off toward land.
----------------------------------------------
“Dad, Mrs. Figg’s got something!” Harry was on the point of unfolding Harry letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of Harry hand by Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you,” Uncle Vernon had said, putting Uncle Vernon large purple face right up close to his money’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Obviously Uncle Vernon’s rations thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail.
----------------------------------------------
You don’t think they’re watching the house?” “Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.
----------------------------------------------
But all he’d tried to do (as all he’d shouted at Uncle Vernon Uncle Vernon through the locked door of Uncle Vernon cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.
----------------------------------------------
Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got ter .” They settled down in The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine Harry flying.
----------------------------------------------
Brought yeh ter this lot ...” “Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
His Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor Harry could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
----------------------------------------------
Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic solutions to Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” At this moment The boat Uncle Vernon had hired bumped gently into the harbor wall.
----------------------------------------------
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of Uncle Vernon newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.
----------------------------------------------
Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, Privet Drive — ’ ” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its beady eyes to the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
No arguments!” Uncle Vernon looked so dangerous with half Uncle Vernon mustache missing that no one dared argue.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was holding a rifle in Uncle Vernon hands — now they knew what had been in the long, thin package Uncle Vernon had brought with they.
----------------------------------------------

“I might get lucky again.” Hermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
what an honor.” Harry hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry Harry and seized Harry hand, tears in Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
The weirdest thing about all these people was the way all these people seemed to vanish Harry Harry tried to get a closer look.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s a broomstick,” That’s a broomstick said, throwing the package from Harry back to Harry Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Neville said to Harry Harry as Harry pushed Harry way into the crowded corridor, “Harry’s a nightmare, honestly.” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing we, Harry Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses askew.
----------------------------------------------
““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, bewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
----------------------------------------------
Then Harry looked up at Harry Harry and said, “If anything happens to Harry, don’t follow.
----------------------------------------------
But the news that Harry was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harrydidn’t know which was worse — people telling Harry Harry’d be brilliant or people telling Harry — people’d be running around underneath Harry holding a mattress.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah,” said Harry, “and Harry Harry doesn’t lose Harry head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid was so huge that Hagrid parted the crowd easily; Harry Harry had to do was keep close behind Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.” Harry Harry woke early the next morning.
----------------------------------------------
And slowly, Harrylooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like Harry, other noses like Harry, even a little old man who looked as though Harry had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry Harry was looking at Harry family, for the first time in Harry life.

Wood
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?” “What’s basketball?” said Oliver Wood curiously.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Oliver Wood was delighted.
----------------------------------------------
Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.” Wood ’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
----------------------------------------------
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harrymounted his new broomstick and kicked off from the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Three of them are called Chasers.” “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Oliver Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood .
----------------------------------------------
Harry landed next to Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall explained.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Harry swung at Harry’s face with the bat to stop Harry’s face from breaking Harry nose, and sent Harry’s face zigzagging away into the air — Harry’s face zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of Harry’s face and managed to pin Harry’s face to the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, Ron just sat and gaped at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Resign?” Wood thundered.
----------------------------------------------
“Very nice,” said Wood, Oliver Wood eyes glinting.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt so ashamed of Harry that Harry went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
----------------------------------------------
Wood cleared Wood throat for silence.
----------------------------------------------
“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep Wood a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
----------------------------------------------
And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or The Bludgers — ” “ — unless they crack my head open.” “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of the Bludgers.” Oliver Wood reached into a large wooden crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
----------------------------------------------
“Right,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie Weasley’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“This,” said Oliver Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and This’s the most important ball of the lot.
----------------------------------------------
the troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up even a troll nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in Harry hand when Harry’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.
----------------------------------------------
“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“We won’t practice with the Golden Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting Wood back inside a large wooden crate, “Wood’s too dark, we might lose Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “We were on the team last year.” “Shut up, you two,” said Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah,” said Harry, “and Harry Harry doesn’t lose Harry head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood was carrying a large wooden crate under Oliver Wood arm.
----------------------------------------------
“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry.
----------------------------------------------
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Professor Flitwick’s class looking confused.
----------------------------------------------
“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into a large wooden crate and strapping a large wooden crate down safely.
----------------------------------------------
Let’s try you out with a few of these.” Harry pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of Harry pocket and a few minutes later, Harry and Harry were up in the air, Oliver Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as Harry could in every direction for Harry to catch.
----------------------------------------------
“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Oliver Wood happily as Oliver Wood trudged back up to the castle.
----------------------------------------------
The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side.
----------------------------------------------
You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when Wood told Fred and George Weasley.” “Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood reckons Wood The boy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in we first week.
----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll show you now,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
“Very good,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane Professor McGonagall was going to use on Harry?
----------------------------------------------

Hogwarts
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with the wooden door windows glowing red in the setting sun.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
These were bookscontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts , and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid works at Hogwarts.” “Oh,” said a boy with a pale, “I’ve heard of a boy with a pale.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” “Er — no,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap Your top hats.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, Snape’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did Snape just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
One morning in mid- December, Hogwarts woke to find Hogwarts covered in several feet of snow.
----------------------------------------------
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” Harry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” “Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” “ Georg e\” “Only joking, a small girl.” the train began to move.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, Harry had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and Harry had no idea how to do it; Harry was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk Harry could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
----------------------------------------------
“If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic.
----------------------------------------------
“They wanted DUMBLEDORE fer Minister, o’ course, but Dumbledore fer ’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.
----------------------------------------------
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around his.
----------------------------------------------
for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.
----------------------------------------------
A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over Hagrid shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” There was a loud “Oooooh!” The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake.
----------------------------------------------
Seven years there and Hogwarts won’t know Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know?
----------------------------------------------
“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach we something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, we heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
The youngest boy had already changed into The youngest boy billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on Harry chest with the letter P on it.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything Hagrid want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts?
----------------------------------------------
Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.
----------------------------------------------
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
You-Know-Who was one.” “Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hogwarts’ll be with youngsters of Hogwarts own sort, fer a change, an’ Hogwarts’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled — ” “I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
“Anyone sitting there?” the youngest redheaded boy asked, pointing at a Hogwarts toilet seat.
----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
A voice echoed through The train: “Ron, will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
----------------------------------------------
“There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” Harry unfolded a second piece of paper Harry hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: .
----------------------------------------------
I thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, my father’d — ” “ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagridgrowled.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Sorcerer
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep it safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew someone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is Ron?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d do with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one.
----------------------------------------------
the Sorcerer’s Stone will transform any metal into pure gold.
----------------------------------------------
Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.” it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” always wanted a dragon, it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” told me so the first time I ever met a dragon,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Nicolas Flamel,” Hermione whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\” This didn’t have quite the effect Hermione’d expected.
----------------------------------------------
“Sorcerer’s St — come an’ see me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think it had anything to do with the Sorcerer’s Stone?” “I’m going to see what section Hagrid was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough of working.
----------------------------------------------
“Now?” “Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall wasn’t that.
----------------------------------------------
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover.
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harryhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on they foreheads, but Harry and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about The Sorcerer’s Stone as HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
“Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” Harry leaned forward.
----------------------------------------------
“And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a the Sorcerer’s Stone’s St — ” “Shhhh\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
----------------------------------------------
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.
----------------------------------------------
If Him’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick Him around like a football?
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.

Gringotts

----------------------------------------------
I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep it safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew someone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
standing rather closer together than flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts would usually have done, peering about nervously.
----------------------------------------------
I hate them Gringotts carts.” Harry did still look a bit sick, so Harryentered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.
----------------------------------------------
Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry remembered Ron telling Harry on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts , but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.
----------------------------------------------
When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, Lord Voldemort was most displeased.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything Hagrid want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
And then yeh gotta find yer way Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken.
----------------------------------------------
“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.
----------------------------------------------
In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
----------------------------------------------
The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts.
----------------------------------------------
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.
----------------------------------------------
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts.
----------------------------------------------
It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet : GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.

Quirrell
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“the Mirror of Erised is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrellmurmured, tapping Quirrell way around the frame.
----------------------------------------------
“Right, stand back, Harry.” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind tapped the wall above the trash can three times with the point of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind umbrella.
----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
They say Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore ticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was pale and looked as though Quirrell was about to cry.
----------------------------------------------
I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered “Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think about he’d.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell’s , Quirrell’s told them, had been given to Quirrell’s by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but them weren’t sure them believed this story.
----------------------------------------------
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened Hermione mouth, perhaps to tell Ronexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harryhissed at Hermione to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Quirrell took one look at even a troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Quirrell, in Professor Quirrell absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was mumbling something.
----------------------------------------------
“What do you reckonhe’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured The chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” them had reached another door.
----------------------------------------------
...” Quirrell came back out from behind the Mirror of Erised and stared hungrily into the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only hear Harry’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
----------------------------------------------
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, them had noticed that a funny smell hung around Quirrell’s turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that Quirrell was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever Quirrell went.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the Mirror of Erised to look at the back.
----------------------------------------------
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.
----------------------------------------------
a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skinlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Scared of the students, scared of Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?” Vampires?
----------------------------------------------
“Quirrell’s too scared to back we up.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around Harry ankles were too tight: Harry tripped and fell over.
----------------------------------------------
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.
----------------------------------------------
Use the boy ...” Quirrell rounded on Harry.
----------------------------------------------
It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though Harry was petrified.
----------------------------------------------
Harry!” Harry felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from Harry grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
I’d have managed that broom before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.” Snape Snape was trying to save me?” “Of course,” said Quirrell coolly.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom straightening his turban.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell raised Quirrell hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — “AAAARGH!” Quirrell rolled off Quirrell, Quirrell face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch Harry bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep his in enough pain to stop his from doing a curse.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
THE MAN WITH TWO FACES It was Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without his turban.
----------------------------------------------
At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; Harry head felt as though it was about to split in two; Harry yelled, struggling with all Harry might, and to Harry surprise, Quirrell let go of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell did not manage to take it from you.
----------------------------------------------
““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, bewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
----------------------------------------------
In the weeks that followed THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but ’d didn’t look as though THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell’d cracked yet.
----------------------------------------------
“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — Snape — ” “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and Quirrell wasn’t Quirrell usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
----------------------------------------------
The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that the Weasley twins followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of Quirrell turban.
----------------------------------------------
Snape probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.
----------------------------------------------
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, Harry thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does.
----------------------------------------------
Help me, “Master!” And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
“If Quirrell’s told Ron how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening Quirrell turban.
----------------------------------------------
I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you — ” “It was you.” “I feared I might be too late.” “You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept Quirrell off the Stone much longer — ” “Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrelltalking and stop Quirrell from concentrating on the Mirror of Erised.
----------------------------------------------
But Dumbledore hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving Dumbledore lips.
----------------------------------------------
Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell face wasn’t twitching at all.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing Quirrell soul with Lord Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell was walking backward at Harry, so that Voldemort could still see Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
----------------------------------------------
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
The pain in Harry head lessened — Harry looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw Harry hunched in pain, looking at Harry fingers — they were blistering before Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
The brick Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind had touched quivered — The brick he had touched wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — The brick he had touched grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
----------------------------------------------
Now give me the Stone, unless you want your mother to have died in vain.” “NEVER!” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell strode out of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed Quirrell.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
two across ...” Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind muttered.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Quidditch
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry needed to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy to forget.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.
----------------------------------------------
At breakfast on Thursday Harry bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages.
----------------------------------------------
By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch.
----------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into the team scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycomplained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with Malfoy narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.
----------------------------------------------
QUIDDITCH As QUIDDITCH entered November, the weather turned very cold.
----------------------------------------------
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around his.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost their all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
----------------------------------------------
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul had happened during a World Cup match in ; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
----------------------------------------------
Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch.
----------------------------------------------
Harry felt so ashamed of Harry that Harry went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
----------------------------------------------
Harry shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook Harry awake.
----------------------------------------------
The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
----------------------------------------------
At either end of the Quidditch field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.
----------------------------------------------
A game of Quidditch only ends when the Golden Snitch is caught, so the Golden Snitch can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, the Golden Snitch had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
----------------------------------------------
The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and Hermione had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” Potter was Quidditch Through the Ages.
----------------------------------------------
Harry now had Hermione as a friend had also lent Harry Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play.
----------------------------------------------
“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Oliver Wood happily as Oliver Wood trudged back up to the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as Your friend Miss Granger rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
“Your father was an excellent Quidditch player himself.” “You’re joking.” It was dinnertime.
----------------------------------------------
You look terrible.” Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t until Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take Harry mind off Harry nerves about tomorrow.
----------------------------------------------
It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” “School Houses.
----------------------------------------------
All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.” “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the Quidditch field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve just got to make sure We play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on We.” Which was all very well, thought Harry, but Harry had another reason for not wanting Snape near Harry while Harry was playing Quidditch.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Slytherin
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.
----------------------------------------------
Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House.
----------------------------------------------
“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl.
----------------------------------------------
In stinking Slytherin.” Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as Slytherin unwrapped the frog.
----------------------------------------------
The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.
----------------------------------------------
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no?
----------------------------------------------
When a pointed wizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still wearing a pointed wizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a pointed wizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when ” Malfoy name was called and got ” Malfoy wish at once: a pointed wizard’s hat had barely touched ” Malfoy when a pointed wizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join ” Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
I do think he’s the Slytherin ghost might have told us prefects, at least.” “And now, before us go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Professor Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into the team scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .
----------------------------------------------
Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on Harry, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup.
----------------------------------------------
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie’s eagle owl was always bringing Malfoy ’s eagle owl packages of sweets from home, which Harry opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?
----------------------------------------------
George WeasleyFilch’s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.” The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says Snape’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!
----------------------------------------------
You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where Their are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find those of wit and learning kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve Those cunning folk ends.
----------------------------------------------
the Great Hall was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Madam Pomfrey’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch ?” A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over Adrian Pucey shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed Adrian Pucey left ear.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was Harry destiny.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Higgs — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” the Slytherins were cheering.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing Harry could say something a bit more interesting.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).
----------------------------------------------
So where shall I put you?” Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” “School Houses.
----------------------------------------------
In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took the huge Slytherin serpent place.
----------------------------------------------
If they won they next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years.
----------------------------------------------
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Mr. Ollivander
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Just take it and give it a wave.” Harry took wand and (feeling foolish) waved wand around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched wand out of Mr. Ollivander hand almost at once.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” Mr. Ollivander said softly.
----------------------------------------------
Well, I say Your fatherfavored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.” Mr. Ollivander had come so close that the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
----------------------------------------------
“That will do,” Mr. Ollivander said, and a long tape measurecrumpled into a heap on the floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry paid seven gold Galleons for Harry wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed seven gold Galleons from Mr. Ollivander shop.
----------------------------------------------
how very curious ...” Mr. Ollivander put Harry’s wand back into Harry’s box and wrapped its box in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious .
----------------------------------------------
“And that’s where ...” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.
----------------------------------------------
The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier Mr. Ollivander seemed to become.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
----------------------------------------------
curious “Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with Mr. Ollivander pale stare.

***********************************************
Hedwig
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“It’s Hedwig’ll have “Charlie’s answer!” The three of them put them heads together to read the note.
----------------------------------------------
Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far.
----------------------------------------------
Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.
----------------------------------------------
Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Percy
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink.
----------------------------------------------
Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing we, Harry Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses askew.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve already told Now Percy’s a prefect We haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but a girl wasn’t listening, a girl was looking at a very battered-looking wand in Now Percy’s a prefect hand.
----------------------------------------------
Off you trot!” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.
----------------------------------------------
“But Percy’d better not see us.” Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom.
----------------------------------------------
Percy crossed a deserted side corridor and disappeared from view.
----------------------------------------------
“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and a portrait of a very fat woman swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.
----------------------------------------------
Percy nearly broke Percy teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in Percy slice.
----------------------------------------------
“Why isn’t Percy down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” “Search me.” Quietly as possible, Quietly crept along the next corridor after Snape ’s fading footsteps.
----------------------------------------------
What a smiling, dimpled woman did have were Now Percy’s a prefect Every Flavor Beans, Bertie Bott’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years.
----------------------------------------------
“Unicorn hairNow Percy’s a prefect nearly poking out.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Neville held up Percy hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy!” hissed Neville , pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to the prefects — ” “Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the red-haired twins , with an air of great surprise.
----------------------------------------------
“A poltergeist.” Percy raised Percy voice, “Peeves — show yourself.” A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
----------------------------------------------
Peering around a large stone griffin, however, “Percy!” saw not Percy but Snape.
----------------------------------------------
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of the people in the portraits along the corridors, and as Percy took a step toward the people in the portraits along the corridors the people in the portraits along the corridors started throwing the people in the portraits along the corridors at Percy.
----------------------------------------------
“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the red-haired twins .
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas is a time for family.” They frog-marched Percy from the room, They frog-marched Percy from the room arms pinned to They frog-marched Percy from the room side by They frog-marched Percy from the room .
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because Percy was so tired and full of food.
----------------------------------------------
Percy seemed to think Percy’d said too much, because Percy went back to staring out of the window.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Now Percy’s a prefect old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside Ron jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.
----------------------------------------------
“All right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.” She kissed Percy on the cheek and Percy left.
----------------------------------------------
All right, Percy, you go first.” What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.
----------------------------------------------
“I think RonNow Percy’s a prefect been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
ItNow Percy’s a prefect been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.” Harry stared.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s Percy doing?” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Nobody in my familyNow Percy’s a prefect magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, my letter’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I“ Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” Hermione Granger said all this very fast.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).
----------------------------------------------
muttered to Percy.
----------------------------------------------
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower ’d stolen his prefect badge.
----------------------------------------------
“Go back to bed!” “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — your brother’s a prefect, your brother’d put a stop to this.” Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
----------------------------------------------
Percy was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as the people in the portraits along the corridors passed, or that Percy Percy led the people in the portraits along the corridors through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries.
----------------------------------------------

Fred
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“I forbid you to ask he, Fred.
----------------------------------------------
Once Harry caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting Harry way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
----------------------------------------------
I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.
----------------------------------------------
Is black-haired boy who was near us in really, Fred?
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and a wizard cracker didn’t just bang, a wizard cracker went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.
----------------------------------------------
Weasley had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping Weasley presents as Weasley, too, carried a lumpy sweater over Weasley arm, which Fred seized.
----------------------------------------------
“Oy, Fred!
----------------------------------------------
“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred and Georgeholding up Harry’s sweater.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Fred was right.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
----------------------------------------------
Good luck, all of you.” Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping Harry knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
But Fred didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would Fred have to do?
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas!” “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and Lee Jordan’s jokes,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep Wood a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of Fred and George Weasley started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
----------------------------------------------
Fred hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Fred and George Weasley haven’t won since Charlie Weasley left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant.
----------------------------------------------
See you.” Fred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Fred looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.
----------------------------------------------
Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.” “The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door.
----------------------------------------------
“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “We were on the team last year.” “Shut up, you two,” said Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“Cheer up,” said Ron, Seamus’s always taking points off Fred and George.
----------------------------------------------
I can see “Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” Fred Weasley smiled down at them.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t you tell I’m George?” “Sorry, I’m George, dear.” “Only joking, I am Fred,” said the oldest boy, and off the oldest boy went.
----------------------------------------------
Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.” “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly.
----------------------------------------------
Yes, trying on a pointed wizard’s hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but Fred did wish they could have tried a pointed wizard’s hat on without everyone watching.
----------------------------------------------
“Fred?
----------------------------------------------
No doubt your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley thought it would amuse you.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll kill Fred, Fred was going on about wrestling a troll.” Harry smiled weakly.
----------------------------------------------
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower ’d stolen his prefect badge.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time Fred and George ’ve been here, and people still like Fred and George .” “Fred and George ’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have Fred and George ?” said Harry miserably.
----------------------------------------------
You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when Wood told Fred and George Weasley.” “Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood reckons Wood The boy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in we first week.
----------------------------------------------
“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and I’m George mess around a lot, but Fred and George still get really good marks and everyone thinks Fred and George’re really funny.
----------------------------------------------
Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think Fred was joking.” Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt.
----------------------------------------------
“This is it.” “The big one,” said Fred Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
“You must be Harry’s family!” said Fred Weasley.

----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Good luck, all of you.” Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping Harry knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told Fred and George Weasley.

George reckons George had a booger-flavored one once.” Ron picked up a green bean, looked at a green bean carefully, and bit into a corner.
----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Ron
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, “That’s — er ...” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
----------------------------------------------
“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.” “You can see your other brothers and everyone any old time,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.
----------------------------------------------
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous.
----------------------------------------------
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever Harry told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess.
----------------------------------------------
He’d be able to read as long as Ron liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid greeted Ron, and Hermione, looking flushed and excited.
----------------------------------------------
“ Weird\ ” Ron said, “What a shape!
----------------------------------------------
Ron’s was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell Ron.
----------------------------------------------
That’ll take a lot of explaining.” Hermione looked convinced, but Only Ron didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Harrythink.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his own wand in the air.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why Ron and Hermione looked so grim and worried, or why Ron and Hermione had Ron and Hermione brought Ron and Hermione wands to the match.
----------------------------------------------
“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” Ron went purple in the face; Ron looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled Harry up a little to take his broomstick even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
----------------------------------------------
To the exam results were still to come great surprise, both Harry and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Ron threw a very battered-looking wand back into his trunk.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, Ron just sat and gaped at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.” “Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at Ron image.
----------------------------------------------
“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as Ron poured sugar on Ron porridge.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering Harry and Ron laughter at HALLOWEEN Malfoy obvious rage and confusion.
----------------------------------------------
Facing Ron and Hermione ’s cheers, way across a brilliantly lit chamber, were the white pieces.
----------------------------------------------
But as Ron and Hermione ’s cheers stepped into a brilliantly lit chamber, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
----------------------------------------------
Never heard of a Wizard’s duel before, I suppose?” “Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermionemuttered as Ron slipped Ron wand up Ron sleeve.
----------------------------------------------
“I think RonNow Percy’s a prefect been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.
----------------------------------------------
“If Quirrell’s told Ron how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Do you think it had anything to do with the Sorcerer’s Stone?” “I’m going to see what section Hagrid was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough of working.
----------------------------------------------
“What should we do?” “Leave it to “.” Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
his broom was vibrating so hard, his broom was almost impossible for Ron to hang on much longer.
----------------------------------------------
Ron’s set was very old and battered.
----------------------------------------------
Once the holidays had started, Ron and his brothers were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry and Ron walked back to the main castle for dinner, Harry and Ron pockets weighed down with rock cakes Harry and Ron ’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given Harry as much to think about as tea with Hagrid .
----------------------------------------------
“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
----------------------------------------------
As They jostled They way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron finally managed to find Harry and Ron way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
----------------------------------------------
A voice echoed through The train: “Ron, will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.” “I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as Ron pulled it over Ron head.
----------------------------------------------
What He, Ron, and Hermione really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down He, Ron, and Hermione necks.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” When Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky letter, Norbert eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg.
----------------------------------------------
“In soccer you get shown the red card and you’re out of the game!” “But this isn’t soccer, Dean Thomas,” Ron reminded Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Ron stared after Hermione, Ron mouth open.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
----------------------------------------------
What are you doing in the library?” Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind Ron back.
----------------------------------------------
Harryglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as Harry was; Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air.
----------------------------------------------
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
----------------------------------------------
it’ll really wipe the smiles off Ron and Hermione faces if we win.” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Ron’s new, too.” the plump woman pointed at the last and youngest of the plump woman sons.
----------------------------------------------
“ Really break your leg,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept to He, Ron, and Hermione, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.
----------------------------------------------
“Maybe Snapefound out how to get past Snape without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding asking Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve already told Now Percy’s a prefect We haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but a girl wasn’t listening, a girl was looking at a very battered-looking wand in Now Percy’s a prefect hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than Harry felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than Harry or Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.
----------------------------------------------
“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Like everything else Ron’s owned, Ron’s set had once belonged to someone else in Ron’s family — in this case, Ron’s grandfather.
----------------------------------------------
Ron appeared out of nowhere as Ron pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m going to play,” Snape told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“You’d think We dragged Hermione along, wouldn’t you?” But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as Ron climbed back into bed.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron Harry and Ron were thinking about what Harry and Ron were about to do.
----------------------------------------------
You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” Both Harry and Ron stood up.
----------------------------------------------
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to his hut.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ignored Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled People as People moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
----------------------------------------------
Ron stared.
----------------------------------------------
“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.” They pulled on They bathrobes, picked up They wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room.
----------------------------------------------
Ron set off, drawing an Invisibility Cloak tight around Ron as Ron walked.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.” “Wow,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met Dumbledore in the entrance hall — Dumbledore already knew — Dumbledore just said, ‘Harry’s gone after Harry, hasn’t Harry?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” “D’you think “D’you meant you to do “D’you?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve heard of Harry family,” said Ron darkly.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------
Ronwas more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harrycouldn’t keep Ron’s eyes off the Famous Witches.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night.
----------------------------------------------
“And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
----------------------------------------------
“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Harry stood quite still, Ron and Harry thinking the same thing — did the an Invisibility Cloak work on cats?
----------------------------------------------
Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to Ron mouth, but Ron’d forgotten all about a piece of steak.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harrysat down next to Ron, “I need to concern” Harry caught sight of Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.
----------------------------------------------
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for Ron, and the other Gryffindors first flying lesson.
----------------------------------------------
Before ” Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of Ron, wrestling Ron to the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Please leave your luggage on The train, The train will be taken to the school separately.” Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, Ron saw, looked pale under Ron freckles.
----------------------------------------------
“Cheer up,” said Ron, Seamus’s always taking points off Fred and George.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. “I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“She hasn’t got much time,” Ron added quickly, “you know, with five of us.” “Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with.
----------------------------------------------
Harry darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as Harry, Ron and Hermione had lost black ones.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was cursing your broomstick, muttering, Ron wouldn’t take his eyes off Ron.” “Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to Ron in the stands.
----------------------------------------------
and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort — ” Ron gasped.
----------------------------------------------
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking Ron head through the branches.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
“ Hermionel” Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron said together.
----------------------------------------------
Ron finally tore Ron’s eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
After all, Harry’d never had any money in Harry life until a month ago, and Harry told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got some presents!” “What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to Ron own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — all right.” Ron cleared Ron throat.
----------------------------------------------
Ron pushed Ron trolley around and stared at the barrier.
----------------------------------------------
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of Ron, and Hermione lesson, the three of Ron, and Hermione dropped Ron, and Hermione trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.
----------------------------------------------
Just as Ronstarted moaning that Ron feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
Something held Ron back — His father’s cloak — Ron felt that this time — the first time — Ron wanted to use it alone.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve got to stand up to Neville, Neville!” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
It was a very dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?” “I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of Harry on Harry and Ron very first morning.
----------------------------------------------
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t allowed Harry Potter.” Ron couldn’t resist it.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Neville , and Hermione moved closer together to block a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from view; Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione very nervous spent most of Ron, and Hermione very nervous free time in Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with Hagrid ’s.
----------------------------------------------
Ron knew old chessmen so well Ron never had trouble getting old chessmen to do what Ron wanted.
----------------------------------------------
“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” Ron waved a very battered-looking wand, but nothing happened.
----------------------------------------------
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off Houses.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was pale green by now.
----------------------------------------------
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harryand Ron thought was very good for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down Ron quill and looking longingly out of the library window.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and his brothers had the dormitory to Ron and his brothers and the common room was far emptier than usual, so Ron and his brothers were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.
----------------------------------------------
Ouch!” Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head.
----------------------------------------------
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and Harry and Ron were quite keen to have another one.
----------------------------------------------
“And send me an owl if you find anything.” “And you could ask your parents if your parents know who Flamel is,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.” “I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and his brothers sat by the hour eating anything Ron and his brothers could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” Ron, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.
----------------------------------------------
Harry remembered Ron telling Harry on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts , but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron stared at Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Harry, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?” Ron glared at her as her left.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at HALLOWEEN Malfoy’s elbow.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s nearly out.” Hagrid ushered Ron, and Hermione inside.
----------------------------------------------
When it bit me Ron told me off for frightening .
----------------------------------------------
“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and Lee Jordan’s jokes,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and a lumpy packagea lumpy package.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother Harry , fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of Harry four-poster.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Now Percy’s a prefect old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside Ron jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
----------------------------------------------
You can start collecting.” Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.
----------------------------------------------
“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
----------------------------------------------
All Harry and Ron really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to Harry and Ron great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t know why ’s so bothered,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.
----------------------------------------------
It was the last thing Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron wanted to do, but what choice did Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron have?
----------------------------------------------
And when I left, Ron was singing a lullaby.” There was a tap on the dark window.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.” Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” Ron said.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy what Harry’d heard.
----------------------------------------------
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all about Harry and Ron first lessons.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled the door open and Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron ran inside.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let Hagrid slip, because how else were Ron, going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?
----------------------------------------------
Ron opened his eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t until Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
----------------------------------------------
“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.” “Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told Ron to be quiet until Hermione’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
“Albus Dumbledoregone!” “Well, you can’t expect Albus Dumbledore to hang around all day,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been doing Malfoy wrong for years.
----------------------------------------------
Where’s Mommy?” “The baby dragon’s lost The baby dragon marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were and carved from what looked like black stone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until Ron heard Ron say, “Hagrid!
----------------------------------------------
“Quick!” Ron threw an Invisibility Cloak back over their as his eyes came round the door.
----------------------------------------------
Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Ron looked very out of place in Ron moleskin overcoat.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time Ron’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom.
----------------------------------------------
“And what do you mean, you’re my second?” “Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting started at last on Ron cold pie.
----------------------------------------------
Red card!” “What are you talking about, Dean Thomas?” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I liked Ron a lot — great with animals.” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
----------------------------------------------
He, Ron, and Hermione had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as He, Ron, and Hermione only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising He, Ron, and Hermione ’d found nothing.
----------------------------------------------
Ron pulled one of four sandwiches apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t like corned beef.” “Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s not just my hand,” Ron whispered, “although that feels like it’s about to fall off.
----------------------------------------------
...” “I can only see you.” “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, Harry couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ronin Harry paisley pajamas.
----------------------------------------------
I told My mom you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” Ron groaned, “My mom’s made you a Weasley sweater.” Harry had torn open a very lumpy parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess.
----------------------------------------------
“Say that again,” Ron said, Ron face as red as Ron hair.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, you wait, it“Charlie’s in Romaniathe best game in the world — ” And Ron was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games Ron’d been to with Ron brothers and the broomstick Ron’d like to get if Ron had the money.
----------------------------------------------
Ron sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though Ron had suddenly realized what Ron was doing, Ron looked quickly out of the window again.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron jumped to Harry and Ron feet.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was almost as tall as the red-haired twins already and Ron nose was still pink where Their mother had rubbed his nose.
----------------------------------------------
“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
----------------------------------------------
“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.
----------------------------------------------
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped the compartment onto an empty seat.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ignored Ron and spoke to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by Harry stunned face that Harry hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
----------------------------------------------
“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally.
----------------------------------------------
It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn’t have everything in life.
----------------------------------------------
“I know Harry’s not very nice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Harry Potter’s , we owe you one!” Only Ron stood by Only Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but The youngest boy grabbed The youngest boy and began rubbing the end of The youngest boy nose.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie’s in Romania were a bit short for Ron, you could see Ron sneakers underneath Ron, .
----------------------------------------------
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking Ron ears.
----------------------------------------------
When Ron and his brothers left the dungeons at the end of Potions, Ron and his brothers found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.
----------------------------------------------
Five minutes later, Ron and his brothers joined Ron, shaking Ron and his brothers heads.
----------------------------------------------
Harry crossed Harry fingers under the table and a second later a pointed wizard’s hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into a large gold chair next to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was going to smash right into the barrier and then Harry’d be in trouble — leaning forward on Harry cart, Ron broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — Harry wouldn’t be able to stop — his cart was out of control — Ron was a foot away — Ron closed Ron eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come ...
----------------------------------------------
“And have you really got — you know ...” Ron pointed at Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoywere saying — ” “Bet you could,” Ron muttered.
----------------------------------------------
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is Ron?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d do with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
the whole crowd was on the whole crowd feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of the whole crowd brooms, but it was no good — every time the whole crowd got near Ron, his broom would jump higher still.
----------------------------------------------
Getting up, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask Snape if Harry could have it.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to Harry feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and Ron muttered that Ron’d brought sandwiches.
----------------------------------------------
“So we’ve just got to try on a pointed wizard’s hat!” Ron whispered to HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
Wheeling around, Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron panic.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione would never let Harry, Ron, and Hermione copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking Hermione to read it through, Harry, Ron, and Hermione got the right answers anyway.
----------------------------------------------
“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s not ages, that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” “But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s for your own good, you know.” “Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves — this was a big mistake.
----------------------------------------------
In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.
----------------------------------------------
Snape hadn’t seen a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but Snape seemed to be looking for a reason to tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione off anyway.
----------------------------------------------
As for Harry and Harry, Harry and Ron legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without Harry and Ron noticing.
----------------------------------------------
George reckons George had a booger-flavored one once.” Ron picked up a green bean, looked at a green bean carefully, and bit into a corner.
----------------------------------------------
a brilliantly lit chamber was so dark Ron and Hermione ’s cheers couldn’t see anything at all.
----------------------------------------------
“There He, Ron, and Hermione is, Mom, there He, Ron, and Hermione is, look!” It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Budge up there, move along.” “Hagrid!” Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Neville
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run — Neville tripped, grabbed Ronaround the waist, and the pair of Neville’s robes toppled right into a suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
Well, think again, boy — that oaf’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.” At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in Neville tracks.
----------------------------------------------
“Do something,” Neville said desperately.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed the story, too?” Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell Harry without words that this wasn’t true, because Nevillewas looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
“I think well be okay — get off Neville !” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione and Neville didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because Hermione and Neville weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to Hermione and Neville, either.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why Ron and Hermione looked so grim and worried, or why Ron and Hermione had Ron and Hermione brought Ron and Hermione wands to the match.
----------------------------------------------
Poor, blundering Neville Harry knew what it must have cost Harry to try and find Neville was looking stunned and hurt in the dark, to warn Neville was looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though Neville’d been making another bid for freedom.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville’s robes’re in here somewhere,” Neville’s robes heard Harry mutter, “probably hiding.” “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, the others began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that Professor Flitwick thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen Professor Flitwick make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom.
----------------------------------------------
On my whistle — three — two — ” But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.
----------------------------------------------
“And I gave ” Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
----------------------------------------------
All Neville cared about was never going near The dog again.
----------------------------------------------
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around his.
----------------------------------------------
Neville must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s arms snapped to Neville’s sides.
----------------------------------------------
“Is it — dead?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.” Neville bent down and pulled his own wand out of the troll’s nose.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Harry as they stepped over Harry and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.
----------------------------------------------
the trolldidn’t even seem to notice a metal pipe hitting a metal pipe shoulder, but a metal pipe heard the yell and paused again, turning a metal pipe ugly snout toward Neville instead, giving Harry time to run around a metal pipe.
----------------------------------------------
Neville pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward they.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve just thought Hermione.” “What about Hermione?” “Hermione doesn’t know about the troll.” Neville bit Neville lip.
----------------------------------------------
When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, his fell over on his way to the stool.
----------------------------------------------
Peeves stuck out Peeves tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head.
----------------------------------------------
“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.” Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” “Oh, Neville,” Harry heard the old woman sigh.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch Neville eye).
----------------------------------------------
Harrystuck his own wand up Harry nose and Neville knocked his own wand out with his own wand own club.
----------------------------------------------
Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Harry heard you.” “So?” said Neville , but Neville looked a bit uncomfortable.
----------------------------------------------
I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.” Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
“I won’t let you do it,” Neville said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had sunk to the third floor in fright; Neville pulled out Neville own wand — not knowing what Neville was going to do Neville heard Neville cry the first spell that came into Neville head: “Wingardium Leviosal” its club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s head.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy!” hissed Neville , pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, Gran brought me up and Mom’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m worth twelve of you, ” Malfoy,” Neville stammered.
----------------------------------------------
“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting cloak behind Harry back.
----------------------------------------------
“Report Neville!” Neville shook Neville head.
----------------------------------------------
I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.” Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under Neville’s left ear, and on “Charlie’s in Romaniasmudged nose.
----------------------------------------------
When Professor McGonagallappeared, Professor McGonagall was leading Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve got to stand up to Neville, Neville!” said Ron.
----------------------------------------------
They all scrambled through a round hole in the wall — Neville needed a leg up — and found They all in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s whole body rigid, Neville’s swayed where Neville’s stood and then fell flat on Neville’s face, stiff as a board.
----------------------------------------------
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, something important.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Neville , and Hermione moved closer together to block a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from view; Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
“it’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.” “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Neville snarled.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, no,” said Neville , pale as the Bloody Baron.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along a hidden passageway and came out near they Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by Harry old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
----------------------------------------------
Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands.
----------------------------------------------
Neville was standing there with his own wand still raised, staring at what Neville had done.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s legs sprang together.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady’s robes had barely whipped round a corner when Neville’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
the troll berserk roared again and started toward Neville , who was nearest and had no way to escape.
----------------------------------------------
Neville looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later the girls had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of the girls minds.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Neville said to Harry Harry as Harry pushed Harry way into the crowded corridor, “Harry’s a nightmare, honestly.” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s legs sprang apart and Neville’s got to Neville’s feet, trembling.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville ...
----------------------------------------------
“Mind you, We did save Neville .” “Neville might not have needed saving if We hadn’t locked the thing in with Neville ,” Harry reminded Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
In stinking Slytherin.” Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as Slytherin unwrapped the frog.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s jaws were jammed together so Neville’s couldn’t speak.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling Neville to do something desperate.
----------------------------------------------
“Percy’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Neville held up Percy hand.
----------------------------------------------
Only Neville’s eyes were moving, looking at Only his eyes in horror.
----------------------------------------------
Neville stared at their guilty faces.
----------------------------------------------
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.
----------------------------------------------
How Neville had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyoneFilch’s guess, because Neville legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Weasley
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Once Harry caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting Harry way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
----------------------------------------------
I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.
----------------------------------------------
Weasley had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping Weasley presents as Weasley, too, carried a lumpy sweater over Weasley arm, which Fred seized.
----------------------------------------------
The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.
----------------------------------------------
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, them had noticed that a funny smell hung around Quirrell’s turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that Quirrell was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever Quirrell went.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s the Weasley twinsjob to protect the Weasley twins side from the Bludgers and try and knock the Weasley twins toward the other team.
----------------------------------------------
“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” Ron went purple in the face; Ron looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
----------------------------------------------
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope all students’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
----------------------------------------------
I told My mom you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” Ron groaned, “My mom’s made you a Weasley sweater.” Harry had torn open a very lumpy parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
----------------------------------------------
“Wood told Fred and George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie Weasley lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas!” “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger have been extremely worried.” “But sir, the Stone — ” “I see you are not to be distracted.
----------------------------------------------
“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep Wood a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of Fred and George Weasley started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
----------------------------------------------
“Fred and George Weasley haven’t won since Charlie Weasley left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant.
----------------------------------------------
But we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and Forge.” “What’s all this noise?” Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie Weasley’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Snape’s obviously spotted some money on the ground!” said ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
See you.” Fred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.” “The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door.
----------------------------------------------
The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that the Weasley twins followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of Quirrell turban.
----------------------------------------------
I can see “Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” Fred Weasley smiled down at them.
----------------------------------------------
No doubt your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley thought it would amuse you.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).
----------------------------------------------
You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when Wood told Fred and George Weasley.” “Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood reckons Wood The boy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in we first week.
----------------------------------------------
Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees his standing alone, the best of all of Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers.
----------------------------------------------
“This is it.” “The big one,” said Fred Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles.
----------------------------------------------
Before Harry could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.
----------------------------------------------
“You must be Harry’s family!” said Fred Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
“There He, Ron, and Hermione is, Mom, there He, Ron, and Hermione is, look!” It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron.

***********************************************
Nicolas Flamel
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Nicolas Flamel wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time ; Nicolas Flamel was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera loverenjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
----------------------------------------------
“Nicolas Flamel,” Hermione whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\” This didn’t have quite the effect Hermione’d expected.
----------------------------------------------
“Yer not still lookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?” “Oh, we found out who Nicolas Flamel is ages ago,” said Ronimpressively.
----------------------------------------------
I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read the name on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore gently is particularly famous for Dumbledore gently defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ Hermione jumped to Hermione .
----------------------------------------------
I might get — thanks Harry turned over the card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel.
----------------------------------------------
it’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.” “we just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s not ages, that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” “But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“But your friend — Nicolas Flamel — ” “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.
----------------------------------------------
“we must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find Nicolas Flamel anywhere — just give we a hint — I know I’ve read Nicolas Flamel name somewhere.” “I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly.

Hermione Granger

----------------------------------------------
Nobody in my familyNow Percy’s a prefect magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, my letter’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I“ Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” Hermione Granger said all this very fast.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s wanted to say something to defend Hermione Granger’s, but there seemed to be something wrong with Hermione Granger’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
only Hermione Granger was on the edge of only Hermione Granger seat and looked desperate to start proving that only Hermione Granger wasn’t a dunderhead.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Hermione Granger’s hadn’t moved at all.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy thought there were “ more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind Hermione Granger’s.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps Professor McGonagall could be Hermione Granger’s assistant.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Hermione
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” Hermione had managed to get to his feet at last.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
----------------------------------------------
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever Harry told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had managed to free Hermione before the plant got a firm grip on Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid greeted Ron, and Hermione, looking flushed and excited.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione and Neville didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because Hermione and Neville weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to Hermione and Neville, either.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell Ron.
----------------------------------------------
That’ll take a lot of explaining.” Hermione looked convinced, but Only Ron didn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Harrythink.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why Ron and Hermione looked so grim and worried, or why Ron and Hermione had Ron and Hermione brought Ron and Hermione wands to the match.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
----------------------------------------------
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned a knight, a bishop, and a castle backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Harry, and Hermione took.
----------------------------------------------
To the exam results were still to come great surprise, both Harry and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy thought there were “ more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harryhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on they foreheads, but Harry and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about The Sorcerer’s Stone as HarryHarry.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.
----------------------------------------------
“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as Harry joined Hermione by the wall, wiping sweat off Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Facing Ron and Hermione ’s cheers, way across a brilliantly lit chamber, were the white pieces.
----------------------------------------------
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table.
----------------------------------------------
But as Ron and Hermione ’s cheers stepped into a brilliantly lit chamber, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
----------------------------------------------
“Granger, Hermione!” Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed a pointed wizard’s hateagerly on Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
----------------------------------------------
“If Quirrell’s told Ron how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“What should we do?” “Leave it to “.” Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered the two boys.
----------------------------------------------
“Go back to bed!” “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — your brother’s a prefect, your brother’d put a stop to this.” Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
----------------------------------------------
“Nicolas Flamel,” Hermione whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\” This didn’t have quite the effect Hermione’d expected.
----------------------------------------------
HarryHarry, relax, Hermione ’s right, The unicorn’s dead safe as long as Dumbledore’s around.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve just thought Hermione.” “What about Hermione?” “Hermione doesn’t know about the troll.” Neville bit Neville lip.
----------------------------------------------
What He, Ron, and Hermione really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down He, Ron, and Hermione necks.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” When Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky letter, Norbert eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg.
----------------------------------------------
Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Ron stared after Hermione, Ron mouth open.
----------------------------------------------
Harryglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as Harry was; Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air.
----------------------------------------------
it’ll really wipe the smiles off Ron and Hermione faces if we win.” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept to He, Ron, and Hermione, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though.
----------------------------------------------
Now Hermione watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off the two boys, but the more the two boys strained against the, the tighter and faster the plant wound around the two boys.
----------------------------------------------
“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.” Every time one of their men was lost, the white piecesshowed no mercy.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.
----------------------------------------------
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Hermione Granger’s hadn’t moved at all.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here Hermione was, pretending Hermione had, to get them out of trouble.
----------------------------------------------
“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“You don’t think the unicorns’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m going to play,” Snape told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“You’d think We dragged Hermione along, wouldn’t you?” But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as Ron climbed back into bed.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione stood up, Hermione crossed fingers in Hermione mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ignored Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“No — but It’s like ice.” “Quick, go, before It wears off.” “Good luck — take care — ” “GO!” Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
----------------------------------------------
“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” “Well,” Hermione exploded, “if “D’you did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” “No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully.
----------------------------------------------
I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read the name on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore gently is particularly famous for Dumbledore gently defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ Hermione jumped to Hermione .
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione ’s cheers echoed around a brilliantly lit chamber.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
it’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.” “we just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had sunk to the third floor in fright; Neville pulled out Neville own wand — not knowing what Neville was going to do Neville heard Neville cry the first spell that came into Neville head: “Wingardium Leviosal” its club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s head.
----------------------------------------------
Midnight ticked nearer as Harry and Hermione heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione know things ...
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had to struggle because the moment Hermione had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around Hermione ankles.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. “I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“I needn’t have learned about the Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Harry said this made Harry feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
----------------------------------------------
The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and Hermione had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
----------------------------------------------
Harry darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as Harry, Ron and Hermione had lost black ones.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps Professor McGonagall could be Hermione Granger’s assistant.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all Hermione notes.
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, are you all right?” Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.
----------------------------------------------
’d half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but Hermione didn’t say a word.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, how many times in our lives are our going to see a dragon hatching?” “our’ve got lessons, our’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone finds out what someone ’s doing — ” “Shut up!” Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
Hermionehad turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady the Fat Lady to get back inside and found Hermione facing an empty painting.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
Forgetting that Harry and Hermione were already invisible, Harry and Hermione shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.
----------------------------------------------
So what do we do, Harry?” The light of adventure was kindling again in Harry’seyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
Right, NOW!” Harry dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package from Harry in Harry’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of Ron, and Hermione lesson, the three of Ron, and Hermione dropped Ron, and Hermione trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.
----------------------------------------------
It was a very dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
only Hermione Granger was on the edge of only Hermione Granger seat and looked desperate to start proving that only Hermione Granger wasn’t a dunderhead.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” Hermione snapped.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Neville , and Hermione moved closer together to block a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from view; Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
----------------------------------------------
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened Hermione mouth, perhaps to tell Ronexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harryhissed at Hermione to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, and Hermione very nervous spent most of Ron, and Hermione very nervous free time in Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with Hagrid ’s.
----------------------------------------------
In a matter of seconds, though, Harry was wide- eyed as Harry began to tell Harry and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
----------------------------------------------
Then a sudden movement ahead of Harry and Hermione made Harry and Hermione almost drop a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harryand Ron thought was very good for Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, us give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in dwarf nor giant insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste twins, though different at first sight Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that Hermione was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s wanted to say something to defend Hermione Granger’s, but there seemed to be something wrong with Hermione Granger’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of Hermione gown, flicked his wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ “Wingardium LeviosaV rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above “Wingardium LeviosaV heads.
----------------------------------------------
“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” Tut ignored Hermione ’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” Ron, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had stopped drawing attention to Hermione in class, keeping Hermione head down and working in silence.
----------------------------------------------
the unicorns had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Harry, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” Snape told Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid’s nearly out.” Hagrid ushered Ron, and Hermione inside.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
not the floorthe Fat Lady’sobviously guarding something.” Hermione stood up, glaring at them.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione slipped back down the spiral staircase, Harry and Hermione hearts as light as Harry and Hermione hands, now that Norbert was off Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get we safely through the black fire, and one will get we back through the purple.” “But how do we know which to drink?” “Give me a minute.” Hermione read this paper several times.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Harry and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.
----------------------------------------------
Neville looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later the girls had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of the girls minds.
----------------------------------------------
Harry now had Hermione as a friend had also lent Harry Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.” Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy what Harry’d heard.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Harry next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
the exams’re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into me.” Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.” “Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told Ron to be quiet until Hermione’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
“I might get lucky again.” Hermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were and carved from what looked like black stone.
----------------------------------------------
We’ll be off, then.” Harry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, staring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked Harry and Hermione view.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for Everyone .
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
“All — all three of us?” “Oh, come off it, you don’t think us’d let you go alone?” “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
He, Ron, and Hermione had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as He, Ron, and Hermione only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising He, Ron, and Hermione ’d found nothing.
----------------------------------------------
“Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, Hermione started looking frantically at the whole crowd.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, Snape’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did Snape just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds.
----------------------------------------------
us kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks, to make Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks forget.” “So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?” Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.
----------------------------------------------
Think havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.” “But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Want to go first, Hermione?” “No, I don’t!” “All right.” Harry gritted Harry teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull Hermione toward the door, but Hermione couldn’t move, Hermione was still flat against the wall, Hermione mouth open with terror.
----------------------------------------------
the troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on.
----------------------------------------------
They tugged and heaved at a heavy wooden door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess.
----------------------------------------------
All right, Harry, Hermione?” “I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” , Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” ’re here to be punished, after all.” “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
----------------------------------------------
“ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and Hermione whipped out Hermione wand, waved her wand, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames Hermione had used on Snape at the plant.
----------------------------------------------
Explain yourselves.” It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s question.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from Hagrid face — Hagrid leapt to Hagrid feet and ran to the window.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione ignored Ron and spoke to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I know Harry’s not very nice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted Harry and Hermione off the path behind a towering oak.
----------------------------------------------
“Harryl” Hermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” again, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry head was still very sore.
----------------------------------------------
My dad says Draco Malfoyfather didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” My dad turned to Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it would go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
----------------------------------------------
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.
----------------------------------------------
And I’d bet my broomstick Harry let that troll in, to make a diversion!” Hermione’s eyes were wide.
----------------------------------------------
Come on, Hermione!” The distant music stopped.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably.
----------------------------------------------
“Hermione, the exams are ages away.” “Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped.
----------------------------------------------
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
----------------------------------------------
Nobody in my familyNow Percy’s a prefect magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, my letter’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I“ Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” Hermione Granger said all this very fast.
----------------------------------------------
My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” On he’s the Slytherin ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).
----------------------------------------------
“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.
----------------------------------------------
Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.
----------------------------------------------
Getting up, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask Snape if Harry could have it.
----------------------------------------------
Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” “Are there many of Harry and Hermione in here?” asked Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s that at it feet?” Hermione whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione would never let Harry, Ron, and Hermione copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking Hermione to read it through, Harry, Ron, and Hermione got the right answers anyway.
----------------------------------------------
“Nearly there!” Harry panted as Harry and Hermione reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s not ages, that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” “But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Snape hadn’t seen a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but Snape seemed to be looking for a reason to tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione off anyway.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.” “I don’t want anything.” “Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione Granger’s wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind Hermione Granger’s.
----------------------------------------------
a brilliantly lit chamber was so dark Ron and Hermione ’s cheers couldn’t see anything at all.
----------------------------------------------
Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell We, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
----------------------------------------------
“Mommy will never forget you!” How Harry and Hermione managed to get a large crate back up to the castle, Harry and Hermione never knew.
----------------------------------------------
“There He, Ron, and Hermione is, Mom, there He, Ron, and Hermione is, look!” It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Budge up there, move along.” “Hagrid!” Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Gryffindor
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns was head of Gryffindor House, but Professor Binns hadn’t stopped Professor Binns from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
----------------------------------------------
Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.
----------------------------------------------
They all scrambled through a round hole in the wall — Neville needed a leg up — and found They all in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
----------------------------------------------
Off you trot!” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.
----------------------------------------------
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Albus Dumbledore was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
— Marcus Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.” It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past Harry head, that it happened.
----------------------------------------------
“ didn’t catch it, nearly swallowed it,” — Marcus Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.
----------------------------------------------
When a pointed wizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still wearing a pointed wizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a pointed wizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when ” Malfoy name was called and got ” Malfoy wish at once: a pointed wizard’s hat had barely touched ” Malfoy when a pointed wizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join ” Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can Gryffindor?” Harry flushed.
----------------------------------------------
D’you think D’you’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup?
----------------------------------------------
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall explained.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.” They pulled on They bathrobes, picked up They wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room.
----------------------------------------------
Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling Neville to do something desperate.
----------------------------------------------
I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.” Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.” A hundred and fifty points lost.
----------------------------------------------
for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.
----------------------------------------------
for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.” The din was deafening.
----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
Neville must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said ” Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where Their are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find those of wit and learning kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve Those cunning folk ends.
----------------------------------------------
“This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years.
----------------------------------------------
“Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before a pointed wizard’s hat declared him a Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be.
----------------------------------------------
Harry crossed Harry fingers under the table and a second later a pointed wizard’s hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into a large gold chair next to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to — Marcus Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower ’d stolen his prefect badge.
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, Harry and the Weasleys returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in Harry new chess set by losing spectacularly to RonRon.
----------------------------------------------
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see “Charlie’s in Romania twin brothers catcalling.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.” “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took the huge Slytherin serpent place.
----------------------------------------------
Five points from Gryffindor.” “He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

Crabbe
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than Harry felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than Harry or Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve never even touched one.” They left the Great Hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before They first class, but halfway across the entrance hall They found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
When a pointed wizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still wearing a pointed wizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a pointed wizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when ” Malfoy name was called and got ” Malfoy wish at once: a pointed wizard’s hat had barely touched ” Malfoy when a pointed wizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join ” Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve met Draco Malfoy before?” Harry explained about — Crabbe and Malfoy meeting in Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
Move along, all of you.” Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy thought there were “ more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
----------------------------------------------
“And I gave ” Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
----------------------------------------------
“Can — Crabbe and Malfoy help you with something?” “You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and the conductor says — Crabbe and Malfoy’re nearly there.
----------------------------------------------
“— Crabbe and Malfoy were some of the first to come back to — Crabbe and Malfoy side after You- Know-Who disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
See you.” Fred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Scabbers the rat was hanging off Scabbers finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbersround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of — Crabbe and Malfoy disappeared at once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
----------------------------------------------
Our new — celebrity.” Draco Malfoy and Draco Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands.
----------------------------------------------
There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of teachers could do more than crack teachers knuckles and scowl.
----------------------------------------------
The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught Malfoy and Crabbe.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy and Crabbe edged along the walls, keeping Malfoy and Crabbe eyes on the doors at either end of the room.

***********************************************
Malfoy
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey Malfoy wanted to borrow one of my books so Malfoy could come and have a good laugh at Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Well, think again, boy — that oaf’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.” At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in Neville tracks.
----------------------------------------------
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?” “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto Harry broomstick and taken off.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
“Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville ...
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy was only a few feet away and Malfoy had stopped dead to listen.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy kept threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — what really bit me — I’ve told Madam Pomfrey — it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — believes me — I shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s why Malfoy’s doing this.” Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned forward and grasped his broom tightly in both hands, and his broom shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
When a pointed wizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still wearing a pointed wizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a pointed wizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when ” Malfoy name was called and got ” Malfoy wish at once: a pointed wizard’s hat had barely touched ” Malfoy when a pointed wizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join ” Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.” Harry had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
----------------------------------------------
“You’ve met Draco Malfoy before?” Harry explained about — Crabbe and Malfoy meeting in Diagon Alley.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycomplained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with Malfoy narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Move along, all of you.” Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.
----------------------------------------------
Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in Draco Malfoy pale cheeks.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Ron and his brothers sat by the hour eating anything Ron and his brothers could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” Ron, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy thought there were “ more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps — Crabbe and Malfoy’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
----------------------------------------------
On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face.
----------------------------------------------
“And I gave ” Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
----------------------------------------------
There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.” “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.
----------------------------------------------
Charlie’s eagle owl was always bringing Malfoy ’s eagle owl packages of sweets from home, which Harry opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
----------------------------------------------
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.” “Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them.
----------------------------------------------
“Can — Crabbe and Malfoy help you with something?” “You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and the conductor says — Crabbe and Malfoy’re nearly there.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at HALLOWEEN Malfoy’s elbow.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.
----------------------------------------------
Holding Malfoy lamp up high, Malfoy pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees.
----------------------------------------------
“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you, eh?” Harry said, leering at Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.
----------------------------------------------
Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering Harry and Ron laughter at HALLOWEEN Malfoy obvious rage and confusion.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said ” Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
----------------------------------------------
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbertthrashing about in a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Snape’s obviously spotted some money on the ground!” said ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“— Crabbe and Malfoy were some of the first to come back to — Crabbe and Malfoy side after You- Know-Who disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
See you.” Fred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
“Look — ” Harry murmured, holding out Harry arm to stop Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
----------------------------------------------
Before ” Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of Ron, wrestling Ron to the ground.
----------------------------------------------
All Harry and Ron really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to Harry and Ron great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m worth twelve of you, ” Malfoy,” Neville stammered.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed.
----------------------------------------------
And what model is it?” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.
----------------------------------------------
“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading Malfoy had gotten a detention, too outside.
----------------------------------------------
Scabbers the rat was hanging off Scabbers finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbersround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of — Crabbe and Malfoy disappeared at once.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt the package from Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the castle.
----------------------------------------------
No sooner were out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned Harry sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
----------------------------------------------
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
----------------------------------------------
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous.
----------------------------------------------
Our new — celebrity.” Draco Malfoy and Draco Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, Malfoy’d spent most of Malfoy childhood zooming around the countryside on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been doing Malfoy wrong for years.
----------------------------------------------
The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught Malfoy and Crabbe.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy and Crabbe edged along the walls, keeping Malfoy and Crabbe eyes on the doors at either end of the room.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Great Hall
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron finally managed to find Harry and Ron way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
----------------------------------------------
Off you trot!” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses.
----------------------------------------------
The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve never even touched one.” They left the Great Hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before They first class, but halfway across the entrance hall They found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
the Great Hall was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Madam Pomfrey’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.
----------------------------------------------
I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.” Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of a rabbit, Harrythought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the Great Hall was now staring at a pointed wizard’s hat, Harry stared at a pointed wizard’s hat, too.
----------------------------------------------
Neville looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later the girls had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of the girls minds.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had gotten used to this by now, but the mail had given Harry a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until about a hundred owls saw about a hundred owls owners, and dropping letters and packages onto about a hundred owls laps.
----------------------------------------------
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Peeves
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filchcursing in rage.
----------------------------------------------
They heard Peeves zooming away, rattling coats of armor as Peeves passed.
----------------------------------------------
Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met Nick when you were late for class.
----------------------------------------------
In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on their.
----------------------------------------------
Nick would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!” Even worse than Peeves the Poltergeist, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.
----------------------------------------------
“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years.
----------------------------------------------
It was a very dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.
----------------------------------------------
...” ’s made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then ’s told them what ’s ’d seen and heard.
----------------------------------------------
“My mistake, My mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie Peevsie little joke, sir.” “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s for your own good, you know.” “Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves — this was a big mistake.
----------------------------------------------
Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity voice, but Peeves eyes glittered wickedly.
----------------------------------------------
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!” Ducking under Peeves, they ran for they lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.
----------------------------------------------
“A poltergeist.” Percy raised Percy voice, “Peeves — show yourself.” A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
----------------------------------------------
“Quick, tell me.” “Say ‘please.’ ” “Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?” “Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.
----------------------------------------------
Peeves stuck out Peeves tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head.
----------------------------------------------
What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give a fat little monk a second chance — ” “My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances a fat little monk deserves?
----------------------------------------------
“In here.” Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall pointed they into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Seamus
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Did something happen to it when — Marcus Flint blocked Harry?” Seamus whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
----------------------------------------------
“My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!” “I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy — ” the ghost in the ruff began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
----------------------------------------------
“Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before a pointed wizard’s hat declared him a Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
“How did Harry get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, Malfoy’d spent most of Malfoy childhood zooming around the countryside on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
“Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.” “Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on Seamus sausages.
----------------------------------------------
“Cheer up,” said Ron, Seamus’s always taking points off Fred and George.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch Neville eye).
----------------------------------------------
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent Harry, and old chessmen didn’t trust Harry at all.
----------------------------------------------
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, them had noticed that a funny smell hung around Quirrell’s turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that Quirrell was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever Quirrell went.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Snape
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Why do you think Snape wanted to referee your next match?
----------------------------------------------
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
----------------------------------------------
“One of we has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staffroom and follow Snape — if Snape — leaves the staffroom.
----------------------------------------------
A sudden yelp told Snape Snape had done Snape job.
----------------------------------------------
“Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell Ron.
----------------------------------------------
“Why isn’t Percy down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” “Search me.” Quietly as possible, Quietly crept along the next corridor after Snape ’s fading footsteps.
----------------------------------------------
Tried to frighten me — as though Snape could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side.
----------------------------------------------
And then, Dumbledore did something Snape could never forgive.” “What?” “Snape saved Snape life.” “What?” “Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily.
----------------------------------------------
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
excellent ...” Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw Snape!” “I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ronnoticed, too.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape opened a small package from his grandmother excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know?
----------------------------------------------
One of Snape legs was bloody and mangled.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape nearly had “Snape leg ripped off once, “Snape’s not going to try it again in a hurry.
----------------------------------------------
And did Hagrid know something about Snape that Snape didn’t want to tell Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
----------------------------------------------
Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch they.” Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.
----------------------------------------------
Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as Your friend Miss Granger rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes.
----------------------------------------------
You look terrible.” Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back!
----------------------------------------------
It’s not exactly a secret we hate Snape, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it up to get Dumbledore sacked.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER!Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as Snape dropped his robes above his knees quickly to hide Snape leg.
----------------------------------------------
“Maybe Snapefound out how to get past Snape without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding asking Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — Snape — ” “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and Quirrell wasn’t Quirrell usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
----------------------------------------------
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was pale and Snape eyes were glittering.
----------------------------------------------
“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw Ron.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
“Well have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.” Snape threw Snape cloak over Snape head and strode out of a shadowy clearing.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m going to play,” Snape told Ron and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“What do you reckonhe’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured The chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” them had reached another door.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
I do believe Professor Snape worked so hard to protect you this year because Professor Snape felt that would make Professor Snape and your father even.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
A barn owl brought Professor Snape a small package from Professor Snape grandmother.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts!
----------------------------------------------
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said ” Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
----------------------------------------------
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Snape’s obviously spotted some money on the ground!” said ” Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
them were standing with them backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard.
----------------------------------------------
Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s found out everything Snape’s needs, and now Snape’s got Dumbledoreout of the way.
----------------------------------------------
Filch and Snape couldn’t see Harry, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if came much nearer they’d knock right into Harry — an Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Harry from being solid.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for everyone else was , Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did the troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape ’s leg off properly.
----------------------------------------------
Filch wouldn’t help we if Filch life depended on his life , Filch’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, Filch’ll think.
----------------------------------------------
Up in the air, Snape turned on Snape broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past Snape, missing Snape by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, Harry arm raised in triumph, the Snitchclasped in the Snitch hand.
----------------------------------------------
Snape suspected me all along.
----------------------------------------------
Five points from Gryffindor.” “He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” Professor Snape whimpered as boils started to pop up all over Professor Snape nose.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
I wouldn’t put anything past Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Snape caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape ’s feelings toward Snape hadn’t changed one jot.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Scooping fire off Snape into a little jar in Snape pocket, Snape scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know what had happened.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — her didn’t even notice ” Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron stared at Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” Snape told Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
I’d have managed that broom before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.” Snape Snape was trying to save me?” “Of course,” said Quirrell coolly.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ...
----------------------------------------------
“a small package from his grandmother’s the Remembrall!” Professor Snape explained.
----------------------------------------------
Wherever Harry was, Filch must know a shortcut, because Harry soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to Harry horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section in the library?
----------------------------------------------
Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.” Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at Snape again.
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
----------------------------------------------
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.
----------------------------------------------
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for Dumbledore, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at Harry scar.
----------------------------------------------
Filch was handing Snape bandages.
----------------------------------------------
Ron, had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let Hagrid slip, because how else were Ron, going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?
----------------------------------------------
“Wonder how long Snape’s going to stay on Snape’s broom this time?
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t until Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was holding Snape robes above Snape knees.
----------------------------------------------
Look, Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter steal ter .” Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the same as Harry was.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was standing there.
----------------------------------------------
Reaching Snape, Snape crouched down, pulled out Snape wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words.
----------------------------------------------
he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but warmth caught every word — like Professor Binns, Professor Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry needed to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy to forget.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House.
----------------------------------------------
“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying.
----------------------------------------------
Snapeonly got to say Snape doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that Snape was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think the troll’ll believe, Snape or we?
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, Snape’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did Snape just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but Harry wasn’t alone.
----------------------------------------------
“I met Snape when I traveled around the world.
----------------------------------------------
Look, you hold it tight like this and if this turns red — oh ...” Professor Snape face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “...
----------------------------------------------
Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape ’s robes.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk.
----------------------------------------------
The idea of Voldemort certainly scared The idea of Voldemort, but The idea of Voldemort didn’t keep visiting The idea of Voldemort in dreams, and The idea of Voldemort were so busy with The idea of Voldemort studying The idea of Voldemort didn’t have much time to fret about what “Snape or anyone else might be up to.
----------------------------------------------
“ Filch’s refereeing?” Snape spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while their tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.
----------------------------------------------
“ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and Hermione whipped out Hermione wand, waved her wand, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames Hermione had used on Snape at the plant.
----------------------------------------------
Peering around a large stone griffin, however, “Percy!” saw not Percy but Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.
----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says Snape’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!
----------------------------------------------
Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.” “The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door.
----------------------------------------------
Snape probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.
----------------------------------------------
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as white as Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
The other two stared at Snape.
----------------------------------------------
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt Harry if Dumbledore gently was watching.
----------------------------------------------
Snape needn’t have bothered.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is Ron?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d do with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one.
----------------------------------------------
“If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Getting up, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask Snape if Harry could have it.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, here goes ...” Snape put Hagrid’s flute to Snape lips and blew.
----------------------------------------------
Snape hadn’t seen a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but Snape seemed to be looking for a reason to tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione off anyway.
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve just got to make sure We play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on We.” Which was all very well, thought Harry, but Harry had another reason for not wanting Snape near Harry while Harry was playing Quidditch.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Filch
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“You are not.” “D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?
----------------------------------------------
“Sniff around, my sweet, “Sniff around, my sweet might be lurking in a corner.” It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris?”.
----------------------------------------------
“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.” Harry had a sudden idea.
----------------------------------------------
In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on their.
----------------------------------------------
As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.
----------------------------------------------
Bin lecturin done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.” “I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, he lamp bobbing away in the darkness.
----------------------------------------------
“ Filch’s refereeing?” Snape spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
----------------------------------------------
All right, Harry, Hermione?” “I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” , Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” ’re here to be punished, after all.” “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
----------------------------------------------
Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity voice, but Peeves eyes glittered wickedly.
----------------------------------------------
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along a hidden passageway and came out near they Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------
“We’d better put cloak on here, and make sure cloak covers all three of We — if Filch spots one of We feet wandering along on its own — ” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the common room.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.
----------------------------------------------
Wherever Harry was, Filch must know a shortcut, because Harry soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to Harry horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section in the library?
----------------------------------------------
Filch took Things down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor, where Things sat and waited without saying a word to each other.
----------------------------------------------
This is the end!” they could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as Filch could toward the Fat Lady’s shouts.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady’s robes had barely whipped round a corner when Neville’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
Filch must have hurried off to look for They somewhere else, because They didn’t see Filch anywhere, but they did hardly cared — all they did wanted to do was put as much space as possible between they did and that monster.
----------------------------------------------
Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch they.” Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid relief must have showed in Hagrid face, because Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?
----------------------------------------------
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.
----------------------------------------------
“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading Malfoy had gotten a detention, too outside.
----------------------------------------------
Filch was handing Snape bandages.
----------------------------------------------
Nick would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!” Even worse than Peeves the Poltergeist, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through Harry, and Harryslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, One bookFilch’s shrieks still ringing in Harry ears.
----------------------------------------------
It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust- colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch’s.
----------------------------------------------
Filch and Snape couldn’t see Harry, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if came much nearer they’d knock right into Harry — an Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Harry from being solid.
----------------------------------------------
Filch wouldn’t help we if Filch life depended on his life , Filch’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, Filch’ll think.

***********************************************
Madam Hooch
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” Madam Hooch said, once they were all gathered around Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
Fred and George Weasley teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived.
----------------------------------------------
On my whistle — three — two — ” But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to — Marcus Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor.
----------------------------------------------
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, Madam Hooch broom in Madam Hooch hand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been doing Malfoy wrong for years.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as white as Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around his.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” Harry ignored Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Professor Snape
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” Professor Snape whimpered as boils started to pop up all over Professor Snape nose.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” “And there’s something else ...” “Fire away.” n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” “Professor Snape .” “Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell hated Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
Look, you hold it tight like this and if this turns red — oh ...” Professor Snape face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “...
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
----------------------------------------------
Can’t get rid of her puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Professor Snape’s lesson.
----------------------------------------------
I do believe Professor Snape worked so hard to protect you this year because Professor Snape felt that would make Professor Snape and your father even.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were low.
----------------------------------------------
A barn owl brought Professor Snape a small package from Professor Snape grandmother.
----------------------------------------------
“a small package from his grandmother’s the Remembrall!” Professor Snape explained.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape opened a small package from his grandmother excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
----------------------------------------------
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to Worst of all hot cauldrons.
----------------------------------------------
you’ve forgotten something ...” Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand.
----------------------------------------------
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
----------------------------------------------
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as white as Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had looked through Harry books at the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
----------------------------------------------
Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Professor Snape.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but warmth caught every word — like Professor Binns, Professor Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Fang
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Then Hagrid voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry pulled the door open.
----------------------------------------------
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking Ron ears.
----------------------------------------------
Fang rested Fang head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over Fang robes.
----------------------------------------------
And We have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Back, Fang.” Harry let Back, Fang.” in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.
----------------------------------------------
There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.” “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.
----------------------------------------------
“Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at Fang heel.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed.
----------------------------------------------
Fang was carrying Fang large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over Fang shoulder.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Fat Lady
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“I’m coming with the Fat Lady,” the Fat Lady said.
----------------------------------------------
The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but Pig won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “How’s your arm?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
----------------------------------------------
not the floorthe Fat Lady’sobviously guarding something.” Hermione stood up, glaring at them.
----------------------------------------------
they did didn’t stop running until they did reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the portrait hole .
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow Harry as quickly as possible; “Sniff around, my sweet scurried silently toward the door, away from the Fat Lady’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
Hermionehad turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady the Fat Lady to get back inside and found Hermione facing an empty painting.
----------------------------------------------
This is the end!” they could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as Filch could toward the Fat Lady’s shouts.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady’s robes had barely whipped round a corner when Neville’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
“Where on earth have you all been?” the Fat Lady asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
----------------------------------------------
we hadn’t had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady.
----------------------------------------------
“Now what am I going to do?” the Fat Lady asked shrilly.
----------------------------------------------

Oliver Wood
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?” “What’s basketball?” said Oliver Wood curiously.
----------------------------------------------
And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or The Bludgers — ” “ — unless they crack my head open.” “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of the Bludgers.” Oliver Wood reached into a large wooden crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
----------------------------------------------
“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived.
----------------------------------------------
“Right,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“This,” said Oliver Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and This’s the most important ball of the lot.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Oliver Wood was delighted.
----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.
----------------------------------------------
“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll show you now,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“Very good,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
Oliver Wood was carrying a large wooden crate under Oliver Wood arm.
----------------------------------------------
“Very nice,” said Wood, Oliver Wood eyes glinting.
----------------------------------------------
Three of them are called Chasers.” “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Oliver Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.
----------------------------------------------
Let’s try you out with a few of these.” Harry pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of Harry pocket and a few minutes later, Harry and Harry were up in the air, Oliver Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as Harry could in every direction for Harry to catch.
----------------------------------------------
“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Oliver Wood happily as Oliver Wood trudged back up to the castle.
----------------------------------------------
Harry landed next to Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Quaffle
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“These two are the Bludgers.” He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the Quaffle.
----------------------------------------------
And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or The Bludgers — ” “ — unless they crack my head open.” “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of the Bludgers.” Oliver Wood reached into a large wooden crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
----------------------------------------------
You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Golden Snitch wins the Golden Snitch team an extra hundred and fifty points, so the Golden Snitch nearly always win.
----------------------------------------------
So — think you’ve got all that?” “Three The Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep The Bludgers away from the Beaters ,” Harry reeled off.
----------------------------------------------
“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Oliver Wood.
----------------------------------------------
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch ?” A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over Adrian Pucey shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed Adrian Pucey left ear.
----------------------------------------------
“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Higgs — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” the Slytherins were cheering.
----------------------------------------------
— Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
----------------------------------------------
Compared with the Quaffle and The Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Fluffy
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
So I told it ter, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’ go shoutin’ about shoutin, what’s the matter with yeh?” “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” “SHHHH!” said Hagrid again.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk.
----------------------------------------------
I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit.
----------------------------------------------
So I told it ter, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm yeh down, jus’ play yeh a bit o’ music an’ yeh’ll go straight off ter sleep — ” Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
----------------------------------------------
“I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy!
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
Snape probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.
----------------------------------------------
“ Fluffy ?” “Yeah — bought off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent to Dumbledore to guard the — ” “Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
----------------------------------------------
“If Quirrell’s told Ron how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell We, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
----------------------------------------------
Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Norbert
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Well, well, well,” Norbert whispered, “we are in trouble.” They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.
----------------------------------------------
a drag — ” Harry looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as a drag — ” Harry towered over the three of them.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” Ron, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.
----------------------------------------------
“It shouldn’t be too difficult — I think it’s still dark big enough to cover two of We and Norbert.” It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him.
----------------------------------------------
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Hermione slipped back down the spiral staircase, Harry and Hermione hearts as light as Harry and Hermione hands, now that Norbert was off Harry and Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” When Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky letter, Norbert eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg.
----------------------------------------------
Midnight ticked nearer as Harry and Hermione heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve decided to call The baby dragon Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at The baby dragon with misty eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Ronan
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
Ronan stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.
----------------------------------------------
A centaur was standing over Harry, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; Harry had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
----------------------------------------------
We’ll be off, then.” Harry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, staring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked Harry and Hermione view.
----------------------------------------------
Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in here lately?
----------------------------------------------
“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, Ronan?
----------------------------------------------
“Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?” Ronan didn’t answer immediately.
----------------------------------------------
At last, Ronan said, “The forest hides many secrets.” A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagridraise Hagrid bow again, but Hagrid was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?” Ronan pawed the ground nervously.
----------------------------------------------
Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed.
----------------------------------------------
I set myself against what is lurking in The forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside myself if I must.” And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best Harry could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind Ronan and Bane.
----------------------------------------------
“So Ronan haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?” Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer.
----------------------------------------------
Anythin’ unusual?” Mars Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched Ronan impatiently.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Bane
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan.
----------------------------------------------
A centaur was standing over Harry, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; Harry had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
----------------------------------------------
We’ll be off, then.” Harry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, staring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked Harry and Hermione view.
----------------------------------------------
Bane kicked Bane back legs in anger.
----------------------------------------------
“Firenze!” Bane thundered.
----------------------------------------------
I set myself against what is lurking in The forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside myself if I must.” And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best Harry could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind Ronan and Bane.

***********************************************
Lord Voldemort
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was.
----------------------------------------------
When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, Lord Voldemort was most displeased.
----------------------------------------------
Since then, I have served Lord Voldemort faithfully, although I have let Lord Voldemort down many times.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort didn’t realize that love as powerful as my mother ’s for you leaves that love as powerful as your mother’s for you own mark.
----------------------------------------------
Tried to frighten me — as though Snape could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side.
----------------------------------------------
“Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, this is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, Yeh’d have found out even if you hadn’t told Yeh.” “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
decided Lord Voldemort would have to keep a closer watch on me.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
But why would Lord Voldemort want to kill me in the first place?” Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
----------------------------------------------
“Lord Voldemort does not forgive mistakes easily.
----------------------------------------------
“Then kill Harry, fool, and be done!” screeched Lord Voldemort.
----------------------------------------------
If there is one thing Lord Voldemort cannot understand, it is love.
----------------------------------------------
the mirror’s almost like “D’you thought I had the right to face Lord Voldemort if I could.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort punished me .
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing Quirrell soul with Lord Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason.
----------------------------------------------
Lord Voldemort said that Lord Voldemort only killed my mother because my mother tried to stop Lord Voldemort from killing me.
----------------------------------------------
Now give me the Stone, unless you want your mother to have died in vain.” “NEVER!” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist.
----------------------------------------------
