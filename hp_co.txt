Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, 
were proud to say that Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four were perfectly normal, 
thank you very much. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four were the last people you’d 
expect to be involved in anything strange or 
mysterious, because Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four just didn’t hold with such 
nonsense. 

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called 
Grunnings, which made drills. Mr. Dursley was a big, beefy 
man with hardly any neck, although Mr. Dursley did have a 
very large mustache. Mr. Dursley was thin and 
blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of 
neck, which came in very useful as Mr. Dursley spent so 
much of Mr. Dursley time craning over garden fences, spying 
on the neighbors. Mr. Dursley had a small son 
called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer 
boy anywhere. 

Mr. Dursley had everything Mr. Dursley wanted, but Mr. Dursley 
also had a secret, and Mr. Dursley greatest fear was that 
somebody would discover 
. Mr. Dursley didn’t think Mr. Dursley 
could bear 
 if anyone found out about the Potters. 
Mr. Dursley was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but Mr. Dursley hadn’t 

Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



met for several years; in fact, Mr. Dursley pretended 
Mr. Dursley didn’t have a sister, because Mr. Dursley sister and Mr. Dursley 
good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it 
was possible to be. Mr. Dursley shuddered to think 
what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in 
the street. Mr. Dursley knew that the Potters had a 
small son, too, but the Potters had a 
small son, too had never even seen a 
small son. 

a 
small son was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; the Potters didn’t want Dudley mixing with a 
child like that. 

When Mr. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray 
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the 
cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and 
mysterious things would soon be happening all over 
the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as Mr. Dursley picked out 
Mr. Dursley most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley 
gossiped away happily as Mrs. Dursley 
 wrestled a screaming 
Dudley into Mr. Dursley high chair. 

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past 
the window. 

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up Mr. Dursleybriefcase, pecked Mr. Dursley on the cheek, and 
tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because 
Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing Dudley 
cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursleyas Mr. Dursley left the house. Mr. Dursley got into Mr. Dursley car and backed 
out of number four’s drive. 

It was on the corner of the street that Mr. Dursley noticed the 
first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a 
map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what Mr. Dursleyhad seen — then Mr. Dursley jerked Mr. Dursley head around to look 
again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner 
of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What 
could Mr. Dursley have been thinking of? It must have been a 
trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at 
Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around 
the corner and up the road, Mr. Dursley watched a tabby cat standing on the corner 
of Privet Drive in Mr. Dursley 
mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet 
Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read 
maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave Mr. Dursley a little shake 
and put a tabby cat standing on the corner 
of Privet Drive out of Mr. Dursley mind. As Mr. Dursley drove toward 
town Mr. Dursley thought of nothing except a large order of 
drills Mr. Dursley was hoping to get that day. 

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of Mr. Dursley 
mind by something else. As Mr. Dursley sat in the usual 
morning traffic jam, Mr. Dursley couldn’t help noticing that 
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people 
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear 
people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups 
you saw on young people! Mr. Dursley supposed this was some 
stupid new fashion. Mr. Dursley drummed Mr. Dursley fingers on the 
steering wheel and Mr. Dursley eyes fell on a huddle of these 
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering 
excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see 
that a couple of They weren’t young at all; why, that 
man had to be older than man was, and wearing an 
emerald-green cloak! The nerve of man! But then The nerve of him 
struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly 
stunt — these people were obviously collecting for 
something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved 
on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the 
Grunnings parking lot, Mr. Dursley mind back on drills. 

Mr. Dursley always sat with Mr. Dursley back to the window in 
Mr. Dursley office on the ninth floor. If Mr. Dursley hadn’t, Mr. Dursley might 
have found it harder to concentrate on drills that 
morning. Mr. Dursley didn’t see the owls swooping past in 
broad daylight, though people down in the street did; 
people pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after 
owl sped overhead. Most of people had never seen an 
owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a 
perfectly normal, owl-free morning. Mr. Dursley yelled at five 
different people. Mr. Dursley made several important telephone 
Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




calls and shouted a bit more. Mr. Dursley was in a very good 
mood until lunchtime, when Mr. Dursley thought Mr. Dursley’d stretch 
Mr. Dursley legs and walk across the road to buy Mr. Dursley a 
bun from the bakery. 

He’d forgotten all about five 
different people until Mr. Dursley 
passed a group of five 
different people next to the baker’s. Mr. Dursley eyed 
five 
different people angrily as Mr. Dursley passed. Mr. Dursley didn’t know why, but 
five 
different people made Mr. Dursley uneasy. This bunch were whispering 
excitedly, too, and Mr. Dursley couldn’t see a single collecting 
tin. It was on Mr. Dursley way back past five 
different people, clutching a 
large doughnut in a bag, that Mr. Dursley caught a few words 
of what five 
different people were saying. 

“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” 

“ — yes, five 
different people son, Harry — ” 

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded Mr. Dursley. Mr. Dursley 
looked back at the whisperers as if Mr. Dursley wanted to say 
something to them, but thought better of the whisperers. 

Mr. Dursley dashed back across the road, hurried up to Mr. Dursley 
office, snapped at Mr. Dursley secretary not to disturb Mr. Dursley, 
seized Mr. Dursley telephone, and had almost finished dialing 
Mr. Dursley home number when Mr. Dursley changed Mr. Dursley mind. Mr. Dursley put 
the receiver back down and stroked Mr. Dursley mustache, 
thinking ... no, Mr. Dursley was being stupid. Potter wasn’t 
such an unusual name. Potter was sure there were lots 
of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. 
Come to think of it, Potter wasn’t even sure Potter nephew 
was called Harry. Potter’d never even seen the boy. It 
might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no 
point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; Mrs. Dursley always got so 
upset at any mention of Mrs. Dursley sister. Potter didn’t blame 
Mrs. Dursley — if Potter’d had a sister like that ... but all the 
same, those people in cloaks ... 



Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Potter found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that 
afternoon and when Potter left the building at five o’clock, 
Potter was still so worried that Potter walked straight into 
someone just outside the door. 

“Sorry,” someone just outside the door. 

 grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled 
and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the tiny old man was wearing a violet 
cloak. the tiny old man didn’t seem at all upset at being almost 
knocked to the ground. On the contrary, the tiny old man face split 
into a wide smile and the tiny old man said in a squeaky voice that 
made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, 
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- 
Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like 
yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy 
day!” 

And the tiny old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the 
middle and walked off. 

Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. Mr. Dursley had been 
hugged by a complete stranger. Mr. Dursley also thought Mr. Dursley 
had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. Mr. Dursley was 
rattled. Mr. Dursley hurried to his car and set off for home, 
hoping Mr. Dursley was imagining things, which Mr. Dursley had never 
hoped before, because Mr. Dursley didn’t approve of 
imagination. 

As Mr. Dursley pulled into the driveway of number four, the 
first thing Mr. Dursley saw — and it didn’t improve Mr. Dursley mood — 
was the tabby cat Mr. Dursley’d spotted that morning. the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning was 
now sitting on Mr. Dursley garden wall. Mr. Dursley was sure the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning was the 
same one; the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning had the same markings around the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning eyes. 

“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. 

the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning didn’t move. the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning just gave Mr. Dursley a stern look. 

Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. 
Trying to pull Mr. Dursley together, Mr. Dursley let Mr. Dursley into the 

Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




house. Mr. Dursley was still determined not to mention 
anything to Mr. Dursley wife. 

Mr. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. Mr. Dursley told 
Mr. Dursley over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems 
with Mr. Dursley daughter and how Dudley had learned a new 
word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. 
When Dudley had been put to bed, Dudley went into the 
living room in time to catch the last report on the 
evening news: 

“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported 
that the nation’s owls have been behaving very 
unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at 
night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have 
been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in 
every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to 
explain why the nation’s owls have suddenly changed the nation’s owls 
sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed The newscaster a 
grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim 
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more 
showers of owls tonight, Jim 
?” 

“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about 
that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting 
oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, 
and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that 
instead of the rain I promised yesterday, Kent, Yorkshire, 
and Dundee’ve had a 
downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have 
been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until 
next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night 
tonight.” 

Mr. Dursley sat frozen in Mr. Dursley armchair. Shooting stars 
all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious 
people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a 
whisper about the Potters . . . 



Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Mr. Dursley came into the living room carrying two 
cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say 
something to Mr. Dursley. Mr. Dursley cleared Mr. Dursley throat nervously. “Er 
— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister 
lately, have you?” 

As Mr. Dursley had expected, Mr. Dursley looked shocked and 
angry. After all, they normally pretended Mr. Dursley didn’t 
have a sister. 

“No,” Mr. Dursley said sharply. “Why?” 

“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. 
“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of 
funny-looking people in town today ...” 

“So?” snapped Mr. Dursley. 

“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to 
do with ... you know ... Mr. Dursley crowd.” 

Mr. Dursley sipped Mr. Dursley tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether Mr. Dursley dared tell Mr. Dursley Mr. Dursley’d 
heard “Harry.” Mr. Dursley decided Mr. Dursley didn’t dare. 
Instead Mr. Dursley said, as casually as Mr. Dursley could, “Owls son — 
Mr. Dursley’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t Mr. Dursley?” 

“I suppose so,” said Mr. Dursley stiffly. 

“What’s Howard again? Howard, isn’t “Harry?” 

“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” 

“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking 
horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.” 

his didn’t say another word on the subject as they 
went upstairs to bed. While Mr. Dursley was in the 
bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window 

Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




and peered down into the front garden. The cat was 
still there. The cat was staring down Privet Drive as though 
The cat were waiting for something. 

Was Mr. Dursley imagining things? Could all this have 
anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out 
that they were related to a pair of — well, Mr. Dursley didn’t 
think Mr. Dursley could bear it. 

The Dursleys got into bed. Mr. Dursley fell asleep 
quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over 
in Mr. Dursley mind. Mr. Dursley last, comforting thought before Mr. Dursley fell 
asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, 
there was no reason for even if the Potters were involved to come near Mr. Dursley and 
Mr. Dursley. the Potters knew very well what Mr. Dursley and 
Petunia thought about even if the Potters were involved and even if the Potters were involved kind. ... Mr. Dursley 
couldn’t see how Mr. Dursley and Petunia could get mixed up 
in anything that might be going on — Mr. Dursley yawned and 
turned over — it couldn’t affect he and Petunia. ... 

How very wrong Mr. Dursley was. 

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy 
sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no 
sign of sleepiness. the cat on the wall outside was sitting as still as a statue, 
the cat on the wall outside eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet 
Drive. the cat on the wall outside didn’t so much as quiver when a car door 
slammed on the next street, nor when two owls 
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight 
before the cat on the wall outside moved at all. 

A man appeared on the corner the cat on the wall outside had been 
watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d 
have thought A man’d just popped out of the ground. the cat on the wall outside’s tail twitched and the cat on the wall outside eyes narrowed. 

Nothing like A man had ever been seen on Privet 
Drive. A man was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the 
silver of A man hair and beard, which were both long 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




enough to tuck into A man belt. A man was wearing long 
robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and 
high-heeled, buckled boots. A man blue eyes were light, 
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles 
and A man nose was very long and crooked, as though it 
had been broken at least twice. A man’s name was 
Albus Dumbledore. 

Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that Albus Dumbledore had 
just arrived in a street where everything from Albus Dumbledore 
name to Albus Dumbledore boots was unwelcome. Albus Dumbledore was busy 
rummaging in Albus Dumbledore cloak, looking for something. But 
Albus Dumbledore did seem to realize Albus Dumbledore was being watched, because 
Albus Dumbledore looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still 
staring at Albus Dumbledore from the other end of the street. For 
some reason, the sight of the cat on the wall outside seemed to amuse 
Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore chuckled and muttered, “I should have 
known.” 

Albus Dumbledore found what Albus Dumbledore was looking for in Albus Dumbledore inside 
pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. Albus Dumbledore 
flicked It open, held It up in the air, and clicked It. 
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. Albus Dumbledore 
clicked The nearest street lamp again — the next lamp flickered into 
darkness. Twelve times Albus Dumbledore clicked the Put-Outer, 
until the only lights left on the whole street were two 
tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of 
the cat watching Albus Dumbledore. If anyone looked out of anyone 
window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, anyone 
wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening 
down on the pavement. Albus Dumbledore slipped the Put- 
Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the 
street toward number four, where Albus Dumbledore sat down on the 
wall next to the cat on the wall outside. Albus Dumbledore didn’t look at the cat on the wall outside, but after a 
moment Albus Dumbledore spoke to the cat on the wall outside. 

“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” 



Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Albus Dumbledore turned to smile at the tabby, but the tabby had gone. 
Instead Albus Dumbledore was smiling at a rather severe-looking 
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the 
shape of the markings the cat on the wall outside had had around the cat on the wall outside 
eyes. a rather severe-looking 
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the 
shape of the markings the cat had had around its 
eyes, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. 
a rather severe-looking 
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the 
shape of the markings the cat had had around its 
eyes black hair was drawn into a tight bun. Her black hairlooked distinctly ruffled. 

“How did you know it was me?” a rather severe-looking 
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the 
shape of the markings the cat had had around its 
eyes asked. 

“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” 

“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all 
day,” said Professor McGonagall. 

“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I 
must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my 
way here.” 

Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. 

“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” a rather severe-looking 
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the 
shape of the markings the cat had had around its 
eyes said 
impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, 
but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s 
going on. It was on they news.” a rather severe-looking 
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the 
shape of the markings the cat had had around its 
eyes jerked a rather severe-looking 
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the 
shape of the markings the cat had had around its 
eyes head 
back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I 
heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, 
Flocks of owls ... shooting stars’re not completely stupid. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars were bound to 
notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll 
bet that was Dedalus Diggle. Kent — I’ll 
bet that was Dedalus Diggle never had much 
sense.” 

“You can’t blame them,” said Albus Dumbledore gently. 
“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven 
years.” 

“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. 

“But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are 
being downright careless, out on the streets in broad 

Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, 
swapping rumors.” 

She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Albus Dumbledore 
here, as though hoping Albus Dumbledore was going to tell She 
something, but Albus Dumbledore didn’t, so She went on. “A fine 
thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who 
seems to have disappeared at last, even the Muggles found 
out about us all. I suppose Albus Dumbledore really has gone, 
Albus Dumbledore?” 

“It certainly seems so,” said Albus Dumbledore. “We have 
much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon 
drop?” 

“A what?” 

“A lemon drop. We’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m 
rather fond of.” 

“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as 
though Professor McGonagall didn’t think this was the moment for 
lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has 
gone — ” 

“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like 
yourself can call a sensible person like 
yourself by a sensible person like 
yourself name? All this You- 
Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been 
trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like 
yourself by a sensible person like 
yourself proper 
name: Voldemort 
.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but 
Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, 
seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we 
keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any 
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort 
’s name.” 

“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, 
sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re 
different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You- 
Know- oh, all right, Voldemort 
, was frightened of.” 

Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You flatter me,” said Albus Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort 
 
had powers I will never have.” 



“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use 
Only because you’re too.” 

“It’s lucky It’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since 
Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” 

Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to 
the rumors that are flying around. You know what 
everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? 

About what finally stopped he?” 

It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the 
point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real 
reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all 
day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman 
fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall 
did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was 
saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until 
Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true. Albus Dumbledore, 
however, was choosing another lemon drop and did 
not answer. 

“What they’re saying,” Professor McGonagall pressed on, “is that last 
night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. last 
night Voldemort 
went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and 
James Potter are — are — that Lily and 
James Potter are —’re — dead.” 

Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head. Professor McGonagall 
gasped. 

“Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to 
believe it ... Oh, Albus ...” 

Albus Dumbledore reached out and patted Albus Dumbledore on the 
shoulder. “I know ... I know ...” Albus Dumbledore said heavily. 

Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went 
on. “it’s dark. 13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying Albus Dumbledore tried to kill the 
Potters’ son, Harry. But — Albus Dumbledore couldn’t. Albus Dumbledore couldn’t 
kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but 
13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Professor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, 
Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why 
Albus Dumbledore’s gone.” 

Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly. 

“It’s — It’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After 
all Albus Dumbledore’s done ... all the people Albus Dumbledore’s killed ... Albus Dumbledore couldn’t 
kill a little boy? It’s just astounding ... of all the 
things to stop Albus Dumbledore . . . but how in the name of heaven 
did Harry survive?” 

“We can only guess,” said Albus Dumbledore. “We may 
never know.” 

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief 
and dabbed at Professor McGonagall eyes beneath Professor McGonagall spectacles. 
Albus Dumbledore gave a great sniff as Albus Dumbledore took a golden 
watch from Albus Dumbledore pocket and examined a golden 
watch from his pocket. It was a very 
odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; 
instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It 
must have made sense to Albus Dumbledore, though, 
because Albus Dumbledore put It back in his pocket and said, 
“Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be 
here, by the way?” 

“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t 
suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all 
places?” 

“I’ve come to bring Harry to Harry aunt and uncle. 
“’re the only family Harry has left now.” 

“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who 
live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to Professor McGonagall 

Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




feet and pointing at number four. “Albus Dumbledore — you 
can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t 
find two people who are less like us. And two people who are less like us’ve got 
this son — I saw this son kicking this son mother all the way 
up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter 
come and live here!” 

“It’s the best place for him,” said Albus Dumbledore firmly. 
“his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything 
to Albus Dumbledore when Albus Dumbledore’s older. I’ve written his aunt and uncle a letter.” 

“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, 
sitting back down on the 
wall. “Really, Albus Dumbledore, 
you think you can explain all this in a letter? These 
people will never understand Albus Dumbledore! Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — 
a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was 
known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will 
be books written about Harry — every child in our 
world will know every child in our 
world name!” 

“Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously 
over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be 
enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can 
walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even 
remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, 
growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take 
it?” 



Professor McGonagall opened Professor McGonagall mouth, changed Professor McGonagall 
mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re 
right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, 
Albus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though 
Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it. 

“Hagrid’s bringing Albus Dumbledore.” 

“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with 
something as important as this?” 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Albus Dumbledore. 

“I’m not saying the boy heart isn’t in the right place,” said 
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t 
pretend the boy’s not careless. the boy does tend to — what 
was that?” 

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around 
them. It grew steadily louder as them looked up and 
down the street for some sign of a headlight; It 
swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — 
and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed 
on the road in front of them. 

If a huge motorcycle was huge, a huge motorcycle was nothing to the man 
sitting astride a huge motorcycle. the man 
 was almost twice as tall as a 
normal man and at least five times as wide. the man 
 looked 
simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long 
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of the man 
 
face, the man 
 had hands the size of trash can lids, and the man 
 
feet in — long 
tangles of bushy black hair and beard leather boots were like baby dolphins. In 
his vast, muscular arms his was holding a bundle of 
blankets. 

“Hagrid,” said Albus Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At 
last. And where did you get a huge motorcycle?” 

“Borrowed a huge motorcycle, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said a huge motorcycle, climbing carefully off a huge motorcycle as he 
spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent a huge motorcycle to me. I’ve got Young Sirius Black, 
sir.” 

“No problems, were there?” 

“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got sir — houseout all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ 
around. Young Sirius Black fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” 



Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward 
over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a 
baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair 
over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped 
cut, like a bolt of lightning. 

“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. 

“Yes,” said Albus Dumbledore. “Hell have that scar forever.” 

“Couldn’t you do something about it, Albus Dumbledore?” 

“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. 

I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect 
map of the London Underground. Well — give him 
here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” 

Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned 
toward the Dursleys’ house. 

“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked 
Hagrid. sir bent sir great, shaggy head over Harryand gave sir what must have been a very scratchy, 
whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl 
like a wounded dog. 

“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the 
Muggles!” 

“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted 
handkerchief and burying sir face in Hagrid. “But I c-c- 
can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little 
Harry live with Muggles — ” 

“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, 
Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as 
Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and 
walked to the front door. Albus Dumbledore laid Harry gently on the 
Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked a letterinside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the 
other two. For a full minute the three of the 
other two stood 
and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders 
shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and 
the twinkling light that usually shone from 
Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. 

“Well,” said Albus Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no 
business staying here. We may as well go and join the 
celebrations.” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best 
get this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall — 
Professor Dumbledore, sir.” 

Wiping Professor McGonagall — 
Professor Dumbledore, sir.”

 jacket sleeve, Hagridswung Professor McGonagall —

 onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the 
engine into life; with a roar the 
engine rose into the air and off 
into the night. 

“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” 
said Albus Dumbledore, nodding to Professor McGonagall. Professor McGonagall blew Professor McGonagall nose in reply. 

Albus Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. 
On the corner Albus Dumbledore stopped and took out the silver Put- 
Outer. Albus Dumbledore clicked the silver Put- 
Outer once, and twelve balls of light 
sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive 
glowed suddenly orange and Albus Dumbledore could make out a 
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end 
of the street. Albus Dumbledore could just see the bundle of blankets 
on the step of number four. 

“Good luck, Harry,” Albus Dumbledore murmured. Albus Dumbledore turned on Albus Dumbledore 
heel and with a swish of his cloak, Albus Dumbledore was gone. 

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which 
lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




place you would expect astonishing things to happen. 
Harry Potter rolled over inside Harry Potter blankets without 
waking up. One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was 
special, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter 
would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. 

Dursley’s scream as Mrs. 

Dursley opened the front door to put 
out the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next 
few weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin 
Dudley. ... Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very 
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country 
were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed 
voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”

THE VANASHIG GLASS 

Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had 
woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but 
Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose 
on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass 
number four on the Dursleys’ front door; The sun crept into 
their living room, which was almost exactly the same 
as The sun had been on the night when Mrs. 

Dursley had 
seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the 
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how 
much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been 
lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach 
ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Mrs. 

Dursley was no longer a baby, and now Only the 
photographs on the mantelpiece showed a large blond boy riding a large blond boy first 
bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer 
game with a large blond boy father, being hugged and kissed by a large blond boymother. 
their living room, which was almost exactly the same 
as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had 
seen that fateful news report about the owls held no sign at a large blond boylived in the house, too. 

Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, 
but not for long. Harry Potter Aunt Petunia was awake and His Aunt Petunia 



Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




was His Aunt Petunia shrill voice that made the first noise of the 
day. 

“Up! Get up! Now!” 

Harry woke with a start. His Aunt Petunia rapped on the door 
again. 

“Up!” His Aunt Petunia screeched. Harry heard His Aunt Petunia walking toward 
the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan 
being put on the stove. Harry rolled onto Harry back and 
tried to remember the dream Harry had been having. It 
had been a good one. There had been a flying 
motorcycle in it. Harry had a funny feeling Harry’d had the 
same dream before. 

His Aunt Petunia was back outside the door 
. 

“Are you up yet?” His Aunt Petunia demanded. 

“Nearly,” said Harry. 

“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the 
bacon. And don’t you dare let the 
bacon burn, I want 
everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” 

Harry groaned. 

“What did you say?” His Aunt Petunia snapped through the door 
. 

“Nothing, nothing ...” 

Dudley’s birthday — how could ” 

Dudley’s birthday have forgotten? 
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for 
socks. Harry found a pair under Harry bed and, after 
pulling a spider off one of a pair, put a pair on. Harrywas used to spiders, because the cupboard under the 
stairs was full of a pair, and that was where Harry slept. 
Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




When Harry was dressed Harry went down the hall into 
the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all 
Dudley’s birthday presents. The table looked as though 
Dudley’s had gotten the new computer Dudley’s wanted, not 
to mention the second television and the racing bike. 
Exactly why Dudley’s wanted a racing bike was a 
mystery to Harry, as Dudley’s was very fat and hated 
exercise — unless of course it involved punching 
somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, 
but Dudley’s couldn’t often catch Dudley’s. Harry didn’t look it, 
but Harry was very fast. 

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark 
cupboard, but Harry had always been small and 
skinny for Harry age. Harry looked even smaller and 
skinnier than Harry really was because all Harry had to 
wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley’s was 
about four times bigger than Harry was. Harry had a thin 
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green 
eyes. Harry wore round glasses held together with a lot 
of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley’s had 
punched Harry on the nose. The only thing Harry liked 
about Harry own appearance was a very thin scar on Harry 
forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. Harry 
had had it as long as Harry could remember, and the 
first question Harry could ever remember asking His Aunt Petunia was how Harry had gotten it. 

“In the car crash when your parents died,” His Aunt Petunia had 
said. “And don’t ask questions.” 

Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a 
quiet life with the Dursleys. 

Uncle Vernon entered 
the kitchen as Harry was 
turning over the bacon. 

“Comb your hair!” Uncle Vernon barked, by way of a morning 
greeting. 

Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top 
of Uncle Vernon newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a 
haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the 
rest of the boys in Harry class put together, but it made 
no difference, Harry hair simply grew that way — all over 
the place. 

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley’s arrived in 
the kitchen with his 
mother. Dudley’s looked a lot like Uncle VernonUncle Vernon. Dudley’s had a large pink face, not much 
neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair 
that lay smoothly on Dudley’s thick, fat head. His Aunt Petuniaoften said that Dudley’s looked like a baby angel — 
Harry often said that Dudley’s looked like a pig in a 
wig. 

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, 
which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. 
Dudley’s, meanwhile, was counting Dudley’s presents. Dudley’s 
face fell. 

“Thirty-six,” Dudley’s said, looking up at Dudley’s mother and 
father. “That’s two less than last year.” 

“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, 
see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and 
Daddy.” 

“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley’s, going red 
in His 
face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley 
tantrum coming on, began wolfing down Dudley 
 bacon as 
fast as possible in case Dudley’s turned the table over. 

His Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because 
His Aunt Petunia said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two 
presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? 
Two more presents. Is that all right?” 



Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard 
work. Finally Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dudley said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty ... 
thirty ...” 

“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said His Aunt Petunia. 

“Oh.” Dudley’s sat down heavily and grabbed the 
nearest parcel. “All right then.” 

Uncle Vernon chuckled. 

“Little tyke wants Little tyke money’s worth, just like Little tyke 
father. ’Atta boy, Dudley’s!” Atta boy, Dudley!” ruffled his money’s hair. 

At that moment the telephone rang and His Aunt Petuniawent to answer the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia 
 while Harry and Uncle Vernon 
watched Dudley’s unwrap the racing bike, a video 
camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new 
computer games, and a VCR. Atta boy, Dudley!” was ripping the 
paper off a gold wristwatch when His Aunt Petunia came 
back from the telephone looking both angry and 
worried. 

“Bad news, Uncle Vernon,” His Aunt Petunia said. “his money’s broken his money’s 
leg. his money’s can’t take Atta boy, Dudley!”.” his money’s jerked his money’s head in 
Harry’s direction. 

Dudley’s’s mouth fell open in horror, but his money’s heart 
gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s’s birthday, Dudley’s 
parents took Dudley’s and a friend out for the day, to 
adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the 
movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. 
Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. 

Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of 
cabbage and Mrs. Figg made Harry look at photographs 
of all the cats she’d ever owned. 

“Now what?” said His Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry Harry as though Harry’d planned this. Harry knew Harry 

Page | 24 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken Mrs. Figg leg, 
but it wasn’t easy when Mrs. Figg reminded Mrs. Figg it would 
be a whole year before Mrs. Figg had to look at Tibbies, 
Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. 

“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. 

“Don’t be silly, Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon hates a large blond boy.” 

the Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as 
though Harry wasn’t there — or rather, as though Harry was 
something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, 
like a slug. 

“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — 
Yvonne?” 

“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped His Aunt Petunia. 

“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully 
(he’d be able to watch what Harry wanted on television 
for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s 
computer) . 

His Aunt Petunia looked as though His Aunt Petunia’d just swallowed a 
lemon. 

“And come back and find The whole house smelled of 
cabbage in ruins?” His Aunt Petunia 
snarled. 

“I won’t blow up The whole house smelled of 
cabbage,” said Harry, but they 
weren’t listening. 

“I suppose we could take Harry to the zoo,” said Aunt 
Petunia slowly, "... and leave Harry in the car. ...” 

“That cars new, Harry’s not sitting in it alone. ...” 



Page | 25 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dudley’s began to cry loudly. In fact, Dudley’s wasn’t really 
crying — it had been years since Dudley’s’d really cried — 
but Dudley’s knew that if Dudley’s screwed up Dudley’s face and 
wailed, Dudley’s would give Dudley’s anything Dudley’s 
wanted. 

“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let Dudley’s 
spoil your special day!” his 
mother cried, flinging his 
mother arms 
around Dudley’s. 

“I ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!” Dudley’syelled between huge, pretend sobs. “Dudley’s always sp- 
spoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through 
the gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. 

Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, 
they’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a 
moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, 
walked in with Dudley’s . Piers was a scrawny boy 
with a face like a rat. a scrawny boy 
 was usually the one who 
held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley’shit their. Dudley’s stopped pretending to cry at once. 

Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe Dudley’s 
luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with 
Piers and Dudley’s, on the way to the zoo for the first 
time in Dudley’s life. Dudley’s aunt and uncle hadn’t been able 
to think of anything else to do with Dudley’s, but before 
His aunt and uncle’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. 

“I’m warning you,” Uncle Vernon had said, putting Uncle Vernon large 
purple face right up close to his money’s, “I’m warning you 
now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — 
and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until 
Christmas.” 

I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly 



Page | 26 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe Uncle Vernon. No one ever did. 



The problem was, strange things often happened 
around Harry and The problem was just no good telling the 
Dursleys Harry didn’t make the 
Dursleys happen. 

Once, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from 
the barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, 
had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair 
so short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, 
which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had 
laughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless 
night imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was 
already laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped 
glasses. Next morning, however, Dudley’s had gotten up to 
find his hair 
 exactly as his hair 
 had been before His Aunt Petunia had sheared his hair 
 off. His Aunt Petunia had been given a week 
in His Aunt Petunia cupboard for this, even though His Aunt Petunia had tried to 
explain that His Aunt Petunia couldn’t explain how it had grown 
back so quickly. 

Another time, His Aunt Petunia had been trying to force 
His Aunt Petunia into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown 
with orange puff balls). The harder His Aunt Petunia tried to pull The 
over His Aunt Petunia head, the smaller it seemed to become, until 
finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but 
certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. His Aunt Petunia had decided 
it must have shrunk in the wash and, to His Aunt Petunia great 
relief, Harry wasn’t punished. 

On the other hand, Harry’d gotten into terrible trouble 
for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. 
Dudley’s gang had been chasing Harry as usual when, 
as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there Harry 
was sitting on the chimney. the Dursleys had 
received a very angry letter from his money’s headmistress 
telling them Harry had been climbing school 
buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as all he’d shouted at Uncle Vernon Uncle Vernon through the locked door of Uncle Vernon 
Page | 27 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans 
outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the 
wind must have caught Harry in mid-jump. 

But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even 
worth being with Dudley’s and Piers to be spending the 
day somewhere that wasn’t school, Dudley’s cupboard, or 
Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. 

While Dudley’s drove, Uncle Vernon complained to His Aunt Petunia. Uncle Vernon liked to complain about things: people at 
work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harrywere just a few of Uncle Vernon favorite subjects. This morning, 
This morning was motorcycles. 

"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” 
he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. 

“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, 
remembering suddenly. “It was flying.” 

Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. Uncle Vernon 
turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, 
Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: 
“MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” 

Dudley and Piers sniggered. 

“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.” 

But Harry wished Harry hadn’t said anything. If there was 
one thing the Dursleys hated even more than Harry 
asking questions, it was Harry talking about anything 
acting in a way the Dursleys shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a 
dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think Harry 
might get dangerous ideas. 

It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was 
crowded with families. the Dursleys bought Dudley 

Page | 28 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance 
and then, because the smiling lady in the van had 
asked Harry what Harry wanted before they could hurry 
Harry away, they bought Harry a cheap lemon ice pop. It 
wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking It as they 
watched a gorilla scratching It head who looked 
remarkably like Dudley’s, except that it wasn’t blond. 

Harry had the best morning Harry’d had in a long time. 
Harry was careful to walk a little way apart from the 
Dursleys so that Dudley’s and Piers, who were starting 
to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t 
fall back on the animals favorite hobby of hitting Harry. the animals 
ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley’s had a 
tantrum because Dudley’s knickerbocker glory didn’t have 
enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought Dudley’s 
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. 

Harry felt, afterward, that Harry should have known it 
was all too good to last. 

After lunch another one and Harry went to the reptile house. the reptile house was cool 
and dark in there, with lit windows all along the 
walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes 
were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and 
stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, 
poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. 
Dudley’s quickly found the largest snake in the place. the largest snake in the place 
could have wrapped the largest snake in the place body twice around Uncle 
Vernon’s car and crushed its body into a trash can — but at 
the moment its body didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was 
fast asleep. 

Dudley’s stood with Dudley’s nose pressed against the glass, 
staring at the glistening brown coils. 

“Make it move,” Dudley’s whined at Dudley’s father. Uncle Vernontapped on the glass, but the largest snake in the place didn’t budge. 



Page | 29 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Do it again,” Dudley’s ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped 
the glass smartly with Uncle Vernon knuckles, but the largest snake in the placejust snoozed on. 

“This is boring,” Dudley’s moaned. Dudley’s shuffled away. 

Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently 
at the largest snake in the place. Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if the largest snake in the place 
had died of boredom itself — no company except 
stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass 
trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than 
having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only 
visitor was His Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to 
wake you up; at least Harry got to visit the rest of the 
house. 

the largest snake in the place suddenly opened the largest snake in the place beady eyes. Slowly, 
very slowly, the largest snake in the place raised the largest snake in the place head until its beady eyes were on a 
level with his money’s. 

the largest snake in the place winked. 

Harry stared. Then Harry looked quickly around to see if 
anyone was watching. anyone weren’t. Harry looked back 
at the largest snake in the place and winked, too. 

the largest snake in the place jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and 
Dudley, then raised its beady eyes to the ceiling. the largest snake in the place gave 
Harry a look that said quite plainly: 

“I get that all the time.” 

“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though 
Harry wasn’t sure the largest snake in the place could hear Harry. “It must be 
really annoying.” 

the largest snake in the place nodded vigorously. 

“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. 

Page | 30 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the largest snake in the place jabbed the largest snake in the place tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at the glass. 

Boa Constrictor, Brazil. 

“Was it nice there?” 

The boa constrictor jabbed The boa constrictor at a little sign again 
and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the 
zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” 

As the largest snake in the place shook the largest snake in the place head, a deafening shout 
behind Harry made both of a deafening shout 
behind Harry jump. “DUDLEY! 
MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT the largest snake in the placeYOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” 

Dudley’s came waddling toward them as fast as Dudley’s 
could. 

“Out of the way, you,” Dudley’s said, punching Harry in the 
ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the 
concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no 
one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and 
Dudley’s were leaning right up close to the glass, the 
next, Piers and 
Dudley had leapt back with howls of horror. 

Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa 
constrictor’s tank had vanished. the largest snake in the place was 
uncoiling the largest snake in the place rapidly, slithering out onto the 
concrete floor. 
People throughout the reptile house screamed and 
started running for the exits. 

As the largest snake in the place slid swiftly past him, Harry could have 
sworn a low, hissing voice said, BrazilBrazil, here I come. 
... Thanksss, amigo.” 

The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. 



Page | 31 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass 
go?” " 

The zoo director himself made His Aunt Petunia a cup of 
strong, sweet tea while The zoo director himself apologized over and over 
again. Piers and 
Dudley could only gibber. As far as 
Harry had seen, the largest snake in the place hadn’t done anything 
except snap playfully at Piers and 
Dudley heels as the largest snake in the place passed, but 
by the time Piers and 
Dudley were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, 
Dudley’s was telling Piers and 
Dudley how the largest snake in the place had nearly bitten off 
Dudley’s leg, while Piers was swearing the largest snake in the place had tried to 
squeeze Dudley’s to death. But worst of all, for Harry at 
least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harrywas talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” 

Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the 
house before starting on Harry. Uncle Vernon was so angry Uncle Vernon 
could hardly speak. Uncle Vernon managed to say, “Go — 
cupboard — stay — no meals,” before Uncle Vernon collapsed 
into a chair, and His Aunt Petunia had to run and get 
Uncle Vernon a large brandy. 

Harry lay in — 
cupboard much later, wishing 
Harry had a watch. Harry didn’t know what time it was and 
Harry couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. 

Until they were, Harry couldn’t risk sneaking to the 
kitchen for some food. 

He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten 
miserable years, as long as Harry could remember, ever 
since Harry’d been a baby and Harry parents had died in 
that car crash. Harry couldn’t remember being in the car 
when his parents had died. Sometimes, when Harry 
strained Harry memory during long hours in Harry 
cupboard, Harry came up with a strange vision: a 
blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on Harry 
forehead. This, Harry supposed, was that car crash, though 
Harry couldn’t imagine where all the green light came 
from. Harry couldn’t remember his parents at all. Harry

aunt and uncle, and of 
course Harry was forbidden to ask questions. There were 
no photographs of the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




aunt and uncle in the house. 

When Harry had been younger, Harry had dreamed and 
dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take 
Harry away, but it had never happened; the Dursleyswere Harry only family. Yet sometimes Harry thought (or 
maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to 
know Harry. Very strange strangers they were, too. A 
tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to A 
tiny man in a violet top hat once 
while out shopping with His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s. 
After asking Harry furiously if Harry knew A 
tiny man in a violet top hat, Aunt 
Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without 
buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed 
all in green had waved merrily at Harry once on a bus. 

A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually 
shaken A bald man in a very long purple coat hand in the street the other day and then 
walked away without a word. The weirdest thing 
about all these people was the way all these people seemed to 
vanish Harry Harry tried to get a closer look. 

At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that 
Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s 
baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody 
liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.

THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE 

The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned 
Harry The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor longest-ever punishment. By the time The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor 
was allowed out of The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor cupboard again, the summer 
holidays had started and Dudley’s had already broken 
Dudley’s new video camera, crashed Dudley’s remote control 
airplane, and, first time out on Dudley’s racing bike, 
knocked down old Mrs. Figg as old Mrs. Figg crossed Privet 
Drive on old Mrs. Figg crutches. 

Harry was glad school was over, but there was no 
escaping Dudley’s’s gang, who visited the house every 
single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were 
all big and stupid, but as Dudley’s was the biggest and 
stupidest of the lot, Dudley’s was the leader. The rest of 
Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s’s favorite 
sport: Harry Hunting. 

This was why Harry spent as much time as possible 
out of the house, wandering around and thinking 
about the end of the holidays, where Harry could see a 
tiny ray of hope. When September came Harry would be 
going off to secondary school and, for the first time in 
Page | 34 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



Harry life, Harry wouldn’t be with Dudley’s. Dudley’s had been 
accepted at Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old private school, 
Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, 
on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the 
local public school. Dudley’s thought this was very 
funny. 

“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day 
at Stonewall,” Dudley’s told Harry. “Want to come upstairs 
and practice?” 

“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had 
anything as horrible as your head down it — it might 
be sick.” Then Dudley’s ran, before Dudley’s could work out 
what Dudley’s’d said. 

One day in July, His Aunt Petunia took Dudley’s to London 
to buy His Aunt Petunia Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. 
Figg’s. old Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. old Mrs. Figg turned out 
old Mrs. Figg’d broken old Mrs. Figg leg tripping over one of old Mrs. Figg cats, and 
old Mrs. Figg didn’t seem quite as fond of her cats as before. old Mrs. Figg 
let Harry watch television and gave Harry a bit of 
chocolate cake that tasted as though old Mrs. Figg’d had ’d for 
several years. 

That evening, Dudley’s paraded around the living room 
for the family in Dudley’s brand-new uniform. Smeltings 
boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, 
and flat straw hats called boaters. Smeltings 
boys also carried 
knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the 
teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be 
good training for later life. 

As he looked at Dudley’s in he new knickerbockers, 
Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest 
moment of he life. His Aunt Petunia burst into tears and 
said His Aunt Petunia couldn’t believe it was His Aunt Petunia Ickle Dudleykins, 
His Aunt Petunia looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t

There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next 
morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed 
to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. Harry 
went to have a look. a large metal tub in the sink was full of what looked 
like dirty rags swimming in gray water. 

“What’s this?” the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 asked His Aunt Petunia. His Aunt Petunia lips 
tightened as they always did if the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 dared to ask a 
question. 

“Your new school uniform,” His Aunt Petunia said. 

Harry looked in the bowl again. 

“Oh,” Harry said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” 

“Don’t be stupid,” snapped His Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing 
some of Dudley’s old things gray for Harry. It’ll look just 
like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” 

Harry seriously doubted this, but thought this best not 
to argue. Harry sat down at the table and tried not to 
think about how Harry was going to look on Harry first day 
at Stonewall High — like Harry was wearing bits of old 
elephant skin, probably. 

Dudley’s and Uncle Vernon came in, both with 
wrinkled noses because of the smell from Mrs. 
Figg’s new 
uniform. Uncle Vernon opened Uncle Vernon newspaper as 
usual and Dudley’s banged Uncle Vernon Smelting stick, which 
Uncle Vernon carried everywhere, on the table. 

both with 
wrinkled noses heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters 
on the doormat. 

Page | 36 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Get the mail, Dudley’s,” said Uncle Vernon from 
behind Uncle Vernon paper. 

“Make Harry get it.” 

“Get the mail, Harry.” 

“Make Dudley’s get it.” 

“Poke Dudley’s with your Smelting stick, Dudley’s.” 

Harry dodged your Smelting stick, Dudley and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard 
from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was 
vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope 
that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. 

Harry picked a bill up and stared at a bill, Harry heart twanging 
like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in Harry whole 
life, had written to Harry. Who would? Harry had no 
friends, no other relatives — Harry didn’t belong to the 
library, so Harry’d never even got rude notes asking for 
books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so 
plainly there could be no mistake: 

Mr. H. Potter 

The Cupboard under the Stairs 
4 Privet Drive 
Little Whinging 
Surrey 

The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish 
parchment, and the address was written in emerald- 
green ink. There was no stamp. 



Page | 37 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Turning The envelope over, Page | 37 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 hand trembling, Harrysaw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, 
an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large 
letter H. 

“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the 
kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter 
bombs?” Harry chuckled at Harry own joke. 

Harry went back to the 
kitchen, still staring at a letter. Harry handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the 
postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open The envelope. 

Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, 
and flipped over the postcard. 

“Mrs. 
Figg’s,” Uncle Vernon informed His Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny 
whelk ...” 

“Dad!” said Dudley’s suddenly. “Dad, Mrs. 
Figg’s got 
something!” 

Harry was on the point of unfolding Harry letter, which 
was written on the same heavy parchment as the 
envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of Harry hand 
by Uncle Vernon. 

“That’s mine\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back. 

“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, 
shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at 
it. Harry face went from red to green faster than a set of 
traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds 
it was the grayish white of old porridge. 

“P-P-Petunia!” P-P-Petunia gasped. 



Page | 38 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of Uncle Vernon reach. His Aunt Petuniatook it curiously and read the first line. For a moment 
it looked as though His Aunt Petunia might faint. His Aunt Petunia clutched His Aunt Petunia 
throat and made a choking noise. 

Uncle VernonUncle Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!” 

They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten 
that Harry and Dudley’s were still in the room. Dudley’swasn’t used to being ignored. Dudley’s gave Dudley’s father a 
sharp tap on the head with Dudley’s Smelting stick. 

“I want to read a letter,” Dudley’s said loudly. 

“I want to read a letter,” said Harry furiously, “as a letter’s mine.” 

“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing 
the letter back inside a letter envelope. 

Harry didn’t move. 

“I WANT MY LETTER!” Harry shouted. 

“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley’s. 

“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and Uncle Vernon took both Harryand Dudley’s by the scruffs of both necks and threw 
both into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind 
both. Harry 
and Dudley promptly had a furious but 
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; 
Dudley’s won, so Harry, Harry glasses dangling from one 
ear, lay flat on Harry stomach to listen at the crack 
between door and floor. 

Uncle Vernon,” His Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering 
voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly 
know where Harry sleeps? You don’t think they’re 
watching the house?” 

Page | 39 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Watching — spying — might be following us,” 
muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. 

“But what should us do, Uncle Vernon? Should us write 
back? Tell they us don’t want — ” 

Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes 
pacing up and down the kitchen. 

“No,” Harry said finally. “No, us’ll ignore it. If they don’t 
get an answer. ... Yes, that’s best ... us won’t do 
anything. ...” 

“But — ” 

“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t us 
swear when us took — ” 

 in we’d stamp out that 
dangerous nonsense?” 

That evening when — ” 

 got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something — ” 

’d never done before; ’dvisited Harry in — ” 

 cupboard. 

“Where’s a letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s 
writing to me?” 

“No one. No one was addressed to you by mistake,” said 
Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned No one.” 

“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “It had my 
cupboard on It.” 

“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of 
spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep 
breaths and then forced He face into a smile, which 
looked quite painful. 



Page | 40 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt 
and I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit 
big for a bit 
 . . . we think it might be nice if you moved 
into Dudley’s’s second bedroom.” 

“Why?” said Harry. 

“Don’t ask questions!” snapped Uncle 
. “Take this 
stuff upstairs, now.” 

The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors 
(usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where 
Dudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys 
and things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom. It 
only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything 
Harry owned from this cupboard to this room. Harry sat 
down on the bed and stared around Harry. Nearly 
everything in here was broken. The month-old video 
camera was lying on top of a small, working tank 
Dudley’s had once driven over the next door neighbor’s 
dog; in the corner was Dudley’s’s first-ever television 
set, which Dudley’s’d put Dudley’s foot through when Dudley’s favorite 
program had been canceled; there was a large 
birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley’shad swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was 
up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley’shad sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. Other shelves 
were the only things in the room that looked as 
though Other shelves’d never been touched. 

From downstairs came the sound of Dudley’s bawling 
at Dudley’s mother, “I don’t want Dudley’s in there ... I need 
this room ... make Dudley’s get out. ...” 

Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday 
Harry’d have given anything to be up here. Today Dudley’s’d 
rather be back in this cupboard with that letter than 
up here without ’d 
. 

Page | 41 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. 
Dudley’s was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, 
kicked his mother, and thrown Dudley’s tortoise through 
the greenhouse roof, and Dudley’s still didn’t have Dudley’s room 
back. Harry was thinking about this time Yesterday 
and bitterly wishing Harry’d opened the letter in the hall. 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each 
other darkly. 

When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to 
be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley’s go and get 
it. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia heard Dudley’s banging things with Dudley’s Smelting 
stick all the way down the hall. Then Dudley’s shouted, 
“There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest 
Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ’ ” 

With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon 
seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry. 
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to 
get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by 
the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around 
the neck from behind. After a minute of confused 
fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the 
Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, 
gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in Harry 
hand. 

“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” Harry 
wheezed at Harry. “Dudley’s — go — just go.” 

Harry walked round and round Harry new room. 
Someone knew Someone had moved out of Someone and 
they seemed to know Someone hadn’t received Someone . Surely that meant they’d try again? And this 
time Someone’d make sure they didn’t fail. Someone had a plan. 

The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next 
morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed

silently crept across the halltoward the front door — 

“AAAAARRRGH ! ” 

Harry leapt into the air; Harry’d trodden on something 
big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\ 

Lights clicked on upstairs and to Harry horror Harryrealized that the big, squashy something had been Harry 
uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot 
of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making 
sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what Harry’d been 
trying to do. Uncle Vernon shouted at Harry for about half an 
hour and then told Harry to go and make a cup of tea. 
Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by 
the time Harry got back, the mail had arrived, right into 
Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters 
addressed in green ink. 

“I want — ” Harry began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing 
three letters 
 before Uncle Vernon eyes. 

Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. Uncle Vernon stayed at 
home and nailed up the mail slot. 

“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a 
mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll 
just give up.” 

“I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” 

“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, 
Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle

On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for HarryHarry. As no less than twelve letters couldn’t go through the mail slot no less than twelve letters 
had been pushed under the door, slotted through the 
sides, and a few even forced through the small 
window in the downstairs bathroom. 

Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all 
the letters, Uncle Vernon got out a hammer and nails and 
boarded up the cracks around the front and back 
doors so no one could go out. Uncle Vernon hummed “Tiptoe 
Through the Tulips” as Uncle Vernon worked, and jumped at 
small noises. 

On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. 
Twenty-four letters to Harry found Twenty-four letters to Harry way into the 
house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two 
dozen eggs that Twenty-four letters to Harry very confused milkman had 
handed His Aunt Petunia through the living room 
window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone 
calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find 
someone to complain to, His Aunt Petunia shredded the 
letters in His Aunt Petunia food processor. 

“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” 
Dudley’s asked Harry in amazement.

On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the 
breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. 

“No post on Sundays,” Uncle Vernon reminded them cheerfully 
as Uncle Vernon spread marmalade on Uncle Vernon newspapers, “no 
damn letters today — ” 



Page | 44 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney 
as Something spoke and caught Something sharply on the back of 
the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came 
pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys 
ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch 
one — 

“Out! OUT!Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and 
threw Harry into the hall. When His Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley arms over Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley faces, 
Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley could 
hear Twenty-four letters to Harry still streaming into the room, 
bouncing off the walls and floor. 

“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak 
calmly but pulling great tufts out of Uncle Vernon mustache at 
the same time. “I want you all back here in five 
minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack 
some clothes. No arguments!” 

Uncle Vernon looked so dangerous with half Uncle Vernon mustache 
missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later 
they had wrenched they way through the boarded-up 
doors and were in the car, speeding toward the 
highway. Dudley’s was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit Dudley’s round the head for holding they 
up while Dudley’s tried to pack Dudley’s television, VCR, and 
computer in Dudley’s sports bag. 

they drove. And they drove. His Aunt Petunia didn’t 
dare ask where they were going. Every now and then 
Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in 
the opposite direction for a while. 

“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” Shake ’em off would mutter 
whenever Shake ’em off did this.

 didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall 
Dudley’s was howling. He’d never had such a bad day 
in Dudley’s life. Dudley’s was hungry, Dudley’s’d missed five television 
programs Dudley’s’d wanted to see, and Dudley’s’d never gone so 
long without blowing up an alien on Dudley’s computer. 

Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- 
looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley’sand Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, 
musty sheets. Dudley’s snored but Harry stayed awake, 
sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of 
passing cars and wondering... 

Dudley 
and Harry ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on 
toast for breakfast the next day. Dudley 
and Harry had just 
finished when the owner of a gloomy- 
looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city came over to 
Dudley 
and Harry table. 

“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I 
got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” 

The woman held up a letter so Dudley 
and Harry could read the green ink 
address: 

Mr. H. Potter 

Room 1 7 

Railview Hotel 

Cokeworth 

Harry made a grab for a letter but Uncle Vernonknocked Uncle Vernon hand out of the way. The woman stared. 

“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up 
quickly and following The woman from the dining room. 

•k k k 

Page | 46 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” His Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear The woman. Exactly what Uncle Vernon was 
looking for, none of them knew. Uncle Vernon drove them into 
the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook 
Uncle Vernon head, got back in the car, and off them went again. 
The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed 
field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the 
top of a multilevel parking garage. 

“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t Uncle Vernon?” Dudley’s asked His Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had 
parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, 
and disappeared. 

It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley’s sniveled. 

“It’s Monday,” Uncle Vernon told Uncle Vernon mother. “The Great 
Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with 
a television.” 

Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was 
Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley’s to 
know the days of the week, because of television — 
then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh 
birthday. Of course, Uncle Vernon birthdays were never exactly 
fun — last year, the Dursleys had given Uncle Vernon a coat 
hanger and a pair of Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, 
you weren’t eleven every day. 

Uncle Vernon was back and Uncle Vernon was smiling. Uncle Vernon was 
also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer 
His Aunt Petunia when His Aunt Petunia asked what Uncle Vernon’d bought. 

“Found the perfect place!” Uncle Vernon said. “Come on! 

Everyone out!” 



Page | 47 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was 
pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at 
sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most 
miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing 
was certain, there was no television in there. 

“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernongleefully, clapping Uncle Vernon hands together. “And this 
gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us this 
gentleman’s boat!” 

A toothless old man came ambling up to them, 
pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat 
bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. 

“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, 
“so all aboard!” 

It was freezing in his boat. Icy sea spray and rain 
crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped 
their faces. After what seemed like hours their 
reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and 
sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. 

The inside was horrible; The inside smelled strongly of 
seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the 
wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. 
There were only two rooms. 

Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips 
each and four bananas. Uncle Vernon’s rations tried to start a fire but the 
empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. 

“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” Uncle Vernon’s rations said 
cheerfully. 

Uncle Vernon’s rations was in a very good mood. Obviously Uncle Vernon’s rations thought 
nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a 
storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though 
the thought didn’t cheer Harry up at all.

As night fell, the promised storm blew up around 
them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls 
of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy 
windows. His Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in 
the second room and made up a bed for Dudley’s on 
the moth-eaten sofa. His Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon went off 
to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find 
the softest bit of floor Harry could and to curl up under 
the thinnest, most ragged blanket. 

the promised storm raged more and more ferociously as the 
night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. Harry shivered and 
turned over, trying to get comfortable, Harry stomach 
rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s’s snores were drowned 
by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. 
The lighted dial of Dudley’s’s watch, which was 
dangling over the edge of 
the moth-eaten sofa on Dudley’s fat wrist, told 
Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. Harry lay and 
watched Harry birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the 
letter writer was now. 

Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak 
outside. Harry hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, 
although Harry might be warmer if the roof did. Four minutes 
to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so 
full of letters when letters got back that Harry’d be able to 
steal one somehow. 

Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard 
on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what 
was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock 
crumbling into 
sea? 

One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds 
... twenty ... ten ... nine — maybe Harry’d wake Dudley’sup, just to annoy Harry — three ... two ... one ... 

BOOM. 

Page | 49 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, 
staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking 
to come in. 



Page | 50 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 

BOOM. Page | 50 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 

BOOM knocked again. Dudley’s jerked awake. 

“Where’s the cannon?” Dudley’s said stupidly. 

There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernoncame skidding into the second room. Uncle Vernon was holding a rifle in 
Uncle Vernon hands — now they knew what had been in the 
long, thin package Uncle Vernon had brought with they. 

“Who’s there?” Uncle Vernon shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!” 

There was a pause. Then — 

SMASH! 

the door was hit with such force that the door swung clean 
off the door hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat 
on the floor. 

A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. A giant of a man 
face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy 
mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could 

Page | 51 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



make out J.K. Rowling 



 eyes, glinting like black beetles under 
all the hair. 

A giant of a man squeezed J.K. Rowling 



 way into the hut, stooping so 
that J.K. Rowling 



 head just brushed the ceiling. J.K. Rowling 



 bent down, 
picked up the door, and fitted the door easily back into the door 
frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. 
J.K. Rowling 



 turned to look at them all. 

“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not 
been an easy journey. ...” 

J.K. Rowling 



 strode over to the sofa where Dudley’s sat frozen 
with fear. 

“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger. 

Dudley’s squeaked and ran to hide behind Dudley’s mother, 
who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. 

“An’ here’s Harry!” said A giant of a man. 

Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face 
and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. 

“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said A giant of a man. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer 
mom’s eyes.Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. 

“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” sir said. “You 
are breaking and entering!” 

“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said A giant of a man; A giant of a man reached over the back of the sofa where Dudley sat frozen 
with fear, jerked the 
gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent the 
gun into a knot 
as easily as if the 
gun had been made of rubber, and threw 
the 
gun into a corner of the second room. 

Page | 52 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a 
mouse being trodden on. 

“Anyway Harry,” said A giant of a man, turning Harry back 
on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to Yeh. Got 
summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some 
point, but it’ll taste all right.” 

From an inside pocket of Yeh black overcoat Yeh pulled 
a slightly squashed box. Harry opened a slightly squashed box with 
trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate 
cake with Harry written on a slightly squashed box in green 
icing. 

Harry looked up at A giant of a man. Harry meant to say thank 
you, but the words got lost on the way to Harry mouth, 
and what Harry said instead was, “Who are you?” 

A giant of a man chuckled. 

“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, 
Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” 

Harry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s 
whole arm. 

“What about that tea then, eh?” Harry said, rubbing Harry 
hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if 

 got 
, mind.” 

Harry eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled 
chip bags in His eyes and Harry snorted. Harry bent down over the 
fireplace; they couldn’t see what Harry was doing but 
when Harry drew back a second later, there was a 
roaring fire there. a 
roaring fire filled the whole damp hut with 
flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over 
Harry as though Harry’d sunk into a hot bath. 



Page | 53 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




A giant of a man sat back down on the sofa, which sagged 
under A giant of a man weight, and began taking all sorts of things 
out of the pockets of A giant of a man coat: a copper kettle, a 
squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, 
several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber 
liquid that A giant of a man took a swig from before starting to 
make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and 
smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while 
A giant of a man was working, but as A giant of a man slid the first six fat, 
juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley’sfidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t 
touch anything Dudley’s gives you, Dudley’s.” 

A giant of a man chuckled darkly. 

“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ 
anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” 

Dudley’s passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry 
Dudley’s had never tasted anything so wonderful, but Dudley’s 
still couldn’t take His eyes off A giant of a man. Finally, as 
nobody seemed about to explain anything, Dudley’s said, 
“I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” 

A giant of a man took a gulp of tea and wiped Dudley’s mouth with 
the back of Dudley’s hand. 

“Call me Hagrid,” Dudley’s said, “everyone does. An’ like I 
told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll 
know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” 

“Er — no,” said Harry. 

Hagrid looked shocked. 

“Sorry,” Harry said quickly. 

“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the 
Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s 

Page | 54 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




them as should be sorry! I knew Yeh weren’t gettin’ 
yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even 
know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh 
never wonder where yer parents learned it all?” 

“All what?” asked Harry. 

“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one 
second!” 

Yeh had leapt to Yeh feet. In Yeh anger Yeh seemed to fill 
the hut. the Dursleys were cowering against 
the wall. 

“Do you mean ter tell me,” Yeh growled at the Dursleys, 
“that Yeh — Yeh! — knows nothin’ abou’ — 
about ANYTHING?” 

Harry thought this was going a bit far. Harry had been to 
school, after all, and Harry marks weren’t bad. 

“I know some things,” Harry said. “I can, you know, do 
math and stuff.” 

But Hagrid simply waved Harry hand and said, “About 
our world, I mean. 
our world. 
our world. Yer parents’ 
world.” 

“What world?” 

Hagrid looked as if Hagrid was about to explode. 
“DURSLEY!” Hagrid boomed. 

Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered 
something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagridstared wildly at Harry. 



Page | 55 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“But Harry must know about yer mom and dad,” Harry 
said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.” 

“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were 
my mom and dad?” 

“Yeh don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran Hagridfingers through Yeh hair, fixing Harry with a 
bewildered stare. 

“Yeh don’ know what Yeh are?” Yeh said finally. 

Uncle Vernon suddenly found Yeh voice. 

“Stop!” Uncle Vernon commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid 
you to tell Yeh anything!” 

A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have 
quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave A braver man than Vernon Dursley; 
when Hagrid spoke, A braver man than Vernon Dursley every syllable trembled with 
rage. 

“You never told A braver man than Vernon Dursley? Never told A braver man than Vernon Dursley what was in the 
letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw 
Dumbledore leave fer him, Vernon Dursley! An’ you’ve kept fer him from 
Dumbledore all these years?” 

“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly. 

“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. 

Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. 

“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of Yeh,” said Hagrid. 
“Harry — yer a wizard.” 

There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and 
the whistling wind could be heard. 



Page | 56 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I’m a what?” gasped Harry. 



“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down 
on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ 
a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained 
up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else 
would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time Yeh read 
yer letter.” 

Harry stretched out Harry hand at last to take the 
yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. 
H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. Harry 
pulled out the letter and read: 

HOGWARTS SCHOOL 
o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY 

Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 

(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf. 

Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of 
Wizards) 

Dear Mr. Potter, 

We are pleased to inform you that you have been 
accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary 
books and equipment. 

Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no 
later than July 31. 

Yours sincerely, 

Minerva McGonagall, 

Deputy Headmistress 



Page | 57 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Questions exploded inside It’s 

 head like fireworks 
and It’s 

 couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few 
minutes It’s 

 stammered, “What does it mean, they 
await your owl?” 

“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, 
clapping a hand to Hagrid forehead with enough force to 
knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket 
inside Hagrid overcoat Hagrid pulled an owl — a real, live, 
rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of 
parchment. With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid 
scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: 

Dear Professor Dumbledore, 

Given Harry Harry letter. 

Taking Harry to buy Harry things tomorrow. 

Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. 

Hagrid 

Hagrid rolled up the note, gave Hagrid 

Hagrid to the owl, which 
clamped Hagrid 

Hagrid in Hagrid 

Hagrid beak, went to the door, and threw 
your owl out into the storm. Then Harry came back and 
sat down as though this was as normal as talking on 
the telephone. 

Harry realized his mouth was open and closed his mouthquickly. 

“Where was I?” said Hagrid 

Hagrid, but at that moment, 

Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very 
angry, moved into the firelight. 

“Harry’s not going,” Harry said. 

Hagrid 

Hagrid grunted. 

Page | 58 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop a great Muggle,” a great Muggle 
said. 



“A what?” said Harry, interested. 

“A Muggle,” said Hagrid 

Hagrid, “A Muggle’s what we call nonmagic 
folk like them. An’ An’’s your bad luck you grew up in a 
family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” 

“we swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to 
that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp 
it out of him! Wizard indeed!” 

“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a 
wizard?” 

“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew\ Of 
course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted 
sister being what my dratted 
sister was? Oh, my dratted 
sister got a letter just 
like that and disappeared off to that — that school — 
and came home every vacation with my dratted 
sister pockets full 
of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the 
only one who saw my dratted 
sister for what my dratted 
sister was — a freak! 

But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this 
and Lily that, my mother and father were proud of having a witch in 
the family!” 

my dratted 
sister stopped to draw a deep breath and then went 
ranting on. It seemed my dratted 
sister had been wanting to say all 
this for years. 

“Then my dratted 
sister met that Potter at school and my mother and father left and 
got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d 
be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — 
abnormal — and then, if you please, my dratted 
sister went and got 
my dratted 
sister blown up and we got landed with my dratted 
sister!” 



Deputy Headmistress 



Page | 57 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 Potter at school had gone very white. As soon as he found he 
voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a 
car crash!” 

“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily 
that the Dursleys scuttled back to they corner. “How 
could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? How 
could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter’s an 
outrage! A scandal! Potter at school not knowin’ Potter at school own 
story when every kid in our world knows Potter at school name!” 

“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently. 

his anger faded from Hagrid face. Harry looked 
suddenly anxious. 

“I never expected this,” Harry said, in a low, worried 
voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there 
might be trouble gettin’ hold of Yeh, how much yeh 
didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right 
person ter tell Yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t 
go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” 

ta threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. 

“Well, it’s best Yeh know as much as I can tell Yeh — 
mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, 
parts of it. ...” 

Yeh sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, 
and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a 
person called — but It’s incredible yeh don’t know — with a 
person called — 
name, everyone in our world knows — ” 

“Who?” 

“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No 
one does.” 

“Why not?” 

Page | 60 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. 
Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard 
who went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. 
Worse than worse. His name was ...” 

Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. 

“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. 

— with a 
person called — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagridshuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this 
— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started 
lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, 
some just wanted a bit o’ — with a 
person called — power, ’cause — with a 
person called — was 
gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. 
Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly 
with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things 
happened. — with a 
person called — was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up 
to — with a 
person called — — an’ — with a 
person called — killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only 
safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s 
the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare 
try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway. 

“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ 
wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwartsin their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know- 
Who never tried to get ’em on You-Know- 
 side before . . . 
probably knew they were too close ter Reckon Dumbledore ter 
want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. 

“Maybe — with a 
person called — thought — with a 
person called — could persuade ’em ... maybe 
— with a 
person called — just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows 
is, — with a 
person called — turned up in the village where you was all 
living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a 
year old. — with a 
person called — came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” 

Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted 
handkerchief and blew Hagrid nose with a sound like a 
foghorn. 

Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Sorry,” Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum 
an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway 



“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the 
real myst’ry of the thing — Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 tried to kill you, too. 
Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or 
maybe Wanted ter just liked killin’ by then. But Wanted ter couldn’t do 
it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer 
forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh 
get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took 
care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it 
didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. 
No one ever lived after No one decided ter kill ’em, no one 
except you, an’ No one’d killed some o’ the best witches 
an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, 
the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you 
lived.” 

Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. 
As Hagrid’s story came to a close, No one saw again the 
blinding flash of green light, more clearly than No one had 
ever remembered it before — and No one remembered 
something else, for the first time in No one life: a high, 
cold, cruel laugh. 

Hagrid was watching Hagrid sadly. 

“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on 
Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...” 

“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; 
Harry had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. 
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back Harry 
courage. Uncle Vernon was glaring at Hagrid and Uncle Vernon fists were 
clenched. 

“Now, you listen here, boy,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “I accept 
there’s something strange about you, probably 

Page | 62 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as 
for all this about your parents, well, your parents were 
weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off 
without your parents in my opinion — asked for all your parents got, 
getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just 
what I expected, always knew your parents’d come to a sticky 
end — ” 

But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and 
drew a battered pink umbrella from inside Hagrid coat. 
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, Uncle Vernon said, 
“I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one 
more word ...” 

In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella 
by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed 
again; Uncle Vernon’s flattened Uncle Vernon’s against the wall and fell 
silent. 

“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and 
sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged 
right down to the floor. 

Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, 
hundreds of them. 

“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You- 
Know-Who?” 

“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same 
night Harry tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more 
famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... Harry was 
gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d ’d go? 

“Some say ’d died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno 
if ’d had enough human left in ’d to die. Some say 
’d’s still out there, bidin’ ’d time, like, but I don’ 
believe it. People who was on ’d side came back ter 



Page | 63 Potter at school and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ 
reckon Some of ’em could’ve done if Don was cornin’ back. 

“Most of us reckon Donsomewhere but 
lost Don powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause 
somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was 
somethin’ goin’ on that night Don hadn’t counted on — 
/ dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ 
about you stumped Don, all right.” 

Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect 
blazing in Hagrid eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling 
pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a 
horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could Him 
possibly be? He’d spent Him life being clouted by 
Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle 
Vernon; if Him was really a wizard, why hadn’t they 
been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried 
to lock Him in Him cupboard? If Him’d once defeated the 
greatest sorcerer in the world, how come 
Dudley had 
always been able to kick Him around like a football? 

Hagrid,” 
Dudley said quietly, “I think you must have 
made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.” 

To 
Dudley surprise, Hagrid chuckled. 

“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when 
you was scared or angry?” 

Harry looked into the fire. Now Harry came to think 
about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made Harry 
aunt and uncle furious with Harry had happened when 
Harry, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by 
Dudley’s gang, Harry had somehow found Harry out of 
he, Harry, reach . . . dreading going to school with that 
ridiculous haircut, Harry’d managed to make it grow 
back . . . and the very last time 
Dudley had hit Harry, 



Page | 64 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




hadn’t Harry got Harry revenge, without even realizing Harry 
was doing it? Hadn’t Harry set a boa constrictor on Harry? 



Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that 
Hagrid was positively beaming at Harry. 

“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you 
wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” 

But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a 
fight. 

“Haven’t I told you Uncle Vernon’s not going?” Uncle Vernon hissed. “Uncle Vernon’s 
going to Stonewall High and Uncle Vernon’ll be grateful for it. I’ve 
read those letters and Uncle Vernon needs all sorts of rubbish — 
spell books and wands and — ” 

“If Uncle Vernon wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop 
Uncle Vernon,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James PotterHe’s 
son goin’ Hogwarts! Yer mad. Hogwarts name’s been 
down ever since Hogwarts was born. Hogwarts’s off ter the finest 
school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven 
years there and Hogwarts won’t know Hogwarts. Hogwarts’ll be with 
youngsters of Hogwarts own sort, fer a change, an’ Hogwarts’ll be 
under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, 
Albus Dumbled — ” 

“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD 
FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon. 

But Hogwarts had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized Hogwarts 
umbrella and whirled his 
umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts 
thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE 
— IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” 

DUMBLEDORE 
 brought the umbrella swishing down through the 
air to point at — there was a flash of violet 
light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and

the next second, 
Dudley was dancing on the spot with 

Dudley hands clasped over 
Dudley fat bottom, howling in 
pain. When 
Dudley turned 
Dudley back on them, Harry saw a 
curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in Harry trousers. 

Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and 

Dudley into the other room, Uncle Vernon cast one last terrified 
look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley. 

Hagrid looked down at his 
umbrella and stroked Hagrid 
beard. 

“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” “Shouldn’ta said ruefully, “but “Shouldn’ta 
didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn Hagrid into a pig, 
but I suppose Hagrid was so much like a pig anyway there 
wasn’t much left ter do.” 

Hagrid cast a sideways look at Harry under Hagrid bushy 
eyebrows. 

“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at 
Hogwarts,” Hagrid said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do 
magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter 
follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ 
the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ” 

“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry. 

“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts Hogwarts but I — er — 
got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. 
They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But 
DUMBLEDORE 
 let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great 
man, Dumbledore.” 

“Why were you expelled?” 

“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” 
said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer 
books an’ that.”

 took off Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 and threw his coat to Harry. 



“You can kip under that,” Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 said. “Don’ mind if it 
wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in 
one o’ the pockets.” 



Page | 67 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 





Harry Harry woke early the next morning. Although Harrycould tell it was daylight, Harry kept his eyes shut tight. 

“It was a dream,” Harry told Harry firmly. “I dreamed a 
giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a 
school for wizards. When I open his eyes I’ll be at 
home in my cupboard.” 

There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. 

And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harrythought, Harry heart sinking. But Harry still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. 

Tap. Tap. Tap“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” 

Harry sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off Harry. The 
hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid ’s was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there 



Page | 68 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



was an owl rapping Hagrid ’s claw on the window, a 
newspaper held in Hagrid ’s beak. 

Harry scrambled to Harry feet, so happy Harry felt as 
though a large balloon was swelling inside Harry. Harry 
went straight to the window and jerked the window open. The 
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of 
Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The 
owl then fluttered 
onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat. 

“Don’t do that.” 

Harry tried to wave The 
owl out of the way, but The 
owlsnapped The 
owl fiercely at Harry and carried on 
savaging Hagrid ’s coat. 

Hagrid ’s!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl — ” 

“Pay There’s an owl — ” 

,” Hagrid ’s grunted into the collapsed sofa. 

“What?” 

“Harry wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the 
pockets.” 

Hagrid ’s ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but 
pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of 
string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harrypulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. 

“Give Harry five Knuts,” said Hagrid ’s sleepily. 

“Knuts?” 

“The little bronze ones.” 

Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and The 
owlheld out Harry leg so Harry could put the money into a 



Page | 69 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




small leather pouch tied to the money. Then Harry flew off 
through the open window. 

Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. 

“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter 
London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” 

Harry was turning over five little bronze coins and looking 
at five little bronze coins. Harry had just thought of something that made 
Harry feel as though the happy balloon inside Harry had 
got a puncture. 

“Urn — Hagrid?” 

“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on Harry huge 
boots. 

“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... Uncle Vernon won’t pay for me to go and 
learn magic.” 

“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up 
and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents 
didn’t leave Hagrid anything?” 

“But if their house was destroyed — ” 

“their didntheir keep their gold in their house, boy! Nah, 
first stop fer us is Gringotts. “Wizards. Have a 
sausage, their’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no 
teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” 

“Wizards have banks?” 

“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.” 

Harry dropped the bit of sausage Harry was holding. 



Page | 70 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Goblins?” 



“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob mad ter, I’ll tell yeh 
that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the 
safest place in the world fer anything Hagrid want ter 
keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ 
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. 
Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew Hagrid up proudly. 
“Hagrid usually gets me ter do important stuff fer Hagrid. 
Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from — knows 
Hagrid can trust me, see. 

“Got everythin’? Come on, then.” 

Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was 
quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. 
The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with 
a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. 

“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around 
for another boat. 

“Flew,” said Hagrid. 

“Flew?” 

“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter 
use magic now I’ve got ter 
.” 

They settled down in The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine Harry flying. 

“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving 
Harry another of Harry sideways looks. “If I was ter — er 
— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not 
mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” 

“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. 
Hagrid pulled out his 
umbrella again, tapped Hagrid 

Page | 71 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




twice on the side of The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, and they sped off toward 
land. 

“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” 
Harry asked. 

“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding Hagrid 
newspaper as Hagrid spoke. “They say there’s dragons 
guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta 
find yer way Gringotts is hundreds of miles under 
London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die 
of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter 
get yer hands on summat.” 

Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read 
Harry newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned 
from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone 
while people did this, but it was very difficult, Harry’d 
never had so many questions in Harry life. 

“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagridmuttered, turning the page. 

“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before Harry 
could stop Harry. 

“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted DUMBLEDORE 
 fer 
Minister, o’ course, but Dumbledore fer 
’d never leave Hogwarts, so 
old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there 
was one. So Dumbledore fer 
 pelts DUMBLEDORE 
 with owls every 
morning, askin’ fer advice.” 

“But what does a Ministry of Magic Ministry of Magic Magic do?” 

“Well, their main job is to keep their main job from the Muggles 
that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the 
country.” 

“Why?” 

Page | 72 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic 
solutions to Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d problems. Nah, we’re best left 
alone.” 

At this moment The boat Uncle Vernon had hired bumped gently into the 
harbor wall. Hagrid folded up Hagrid newspaper, and 
they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. 

Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked 
through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t 
blame they. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as 
anyone else, Harry kept pointing at perfectly ordinary 
things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See 
that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” 

“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep 
up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” 

“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a 
dragon.” 

“You’d like one?” 

“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.” 

They had reached the station. There was a train to 
London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t 
understand “Muggle money,” as Muggle called it, gave the 
bills to Harry so Muggle could buy Hagrid, who didn’t 
 tickets. 

People stared more than ever on a train to 
London in five minutes’ time. Hagridtook up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a 
canary-yellow circus tent. 

“Still got yer letter, Harry?” Hagrid asked as Hagrid counted 
stitches. 

Harry took the parchment envelope out of Harry pocket. 



Page | 73 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything 
yeh need.” 



Harry unfolded a second piece of paper Harry hadn’t 
noticed the night before, and read:

“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered 
aloud. 

“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid. 

Harry had never been to London before. Although 
Hagrid seemed to know where Harry was going, Harry was 
obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary 
way. Harry got stuck in the ticket barrier on the 
Underground, and complained loudly that the seats 
were too small and the trains too slow. 

Page | 75 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t know how the Muggles 
 manage without 
magic,” Harry said as they climbed a broken-down 
escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with 
shops. 

Hagrid was so huge that Hagrid parted the crowd easily; 
Harry Harry had to do was keep close behind Hagrid. Harry 
passed book shops and music stores, hamburger 
restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as 
if 
 could sell you a magic wand. This was just an 
ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there 
really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath 
them? Were there really shops that sold spell books 
and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge 
joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t 
known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, Harry hadmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though 
everything Hagrid had told Harry so far was 
unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting Harry. 

“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky 
Cauldron. the Leaky 
Cauldron’s a famous place.” 

the Leaky 
Cauldron was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t 
pointed Hagrid hadn’t 
 out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed Hagrid hadn’t 
 was 
there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at Hagrid hadn’t 
. The people hurryingeyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the 
record shop on the other as if Their 
eyes couldn’t see the 
Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most 
peculiar feeling that only Harry and Hagrid could see it. 
Before Harry could mention this, Hagrid had steered Harry 
inside. 

For a famous place, Hagrid was very dark and shabby. A 
few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny 
glasses of sherry. One of A 
few old women was smoking a long 
pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old 
bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a 
toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped 
Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




when Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 walked in. Everyone seemed to know 
Hagrid; Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 waved and smiled at Hagrid, and the 
bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, 
Hagrid?” 

“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, 
clapping Hagrid great hand on Harry’s shoulder and 
making Harry’s knees buckle. 

“Good Lord,” said the 
bartender, peering at Harry, “is 
this — can this be — ?” 

The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely 
still and silent. 

“Bless my soul,” whispered the 
bartender, “HarryPotter ... what an honor.” 

Harry hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry Harry and seized Harry hand, tears in Harry eyes. 

“Welcome back, Harry 
Potter ..., welcome back.” 

Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking 
at Harry. The old woman with a long 
pipe was puffing on The old woman with the pipe 
without realizing The old woman with the pipe had gone out. Hagrid was 
beaming. 

Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the 
next moment, Harry found Harry shaking hands 
with everyone in The Leaky Cauldron. 

“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting 
you at last.” 

“So proud, Harry 
Potter ..., I’m just so proud.” 

“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a 
flutter.” 

Page | 77 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the 
name, Dedalus Diggle.” 

“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s 
top hat fell off in Harry excitement. “You bowed to me 
once in a shop.” 

“Harry remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking 
around at everyone. “Did you hear that? Harry 
remembers me!” 

Harry shook hands again and again — Doris 
Crockford kept coming back for more. 

A pale young man made A pale young man way forward, very 
nervously. One of A pale young man eyes was twitching. 

“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor 
Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” 

“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping 
Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to 
meet you.” 

“What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” 

“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered 
“Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think 
about he’d. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” 

“Professor Quirrell laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your 
equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- 
book on vampires, m-myself.” “Professor Quirrell looked terrified at 
the very thought. 

But the others wouldn’t let “Professor Quirrell keep 
Harry to “Professor Quirrell. It took almost ten minutes to get 
away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make 
Hagrid heard over the babble. 



Page | 78 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.” 

Doris 
Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, 
and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a 
small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but 
a trash can and a few weeds. 

Hagrid grinned at Harry. 

“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
you, Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
’s usually tremblin’.” 

“Is Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 always that nervous?” 

“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 was fine 
while Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 was studyin’ outta books but then Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 took a 
year off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say 
Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a 
nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same 
since. Scared of the students, scared of Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 own 
subject — now, where’s me umbrella?” 

Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. 

Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall 
above the trash can. 

“Three up ... two across ...” Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 muttered. “Right, 
stand back, Harry.” 

Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 tapped the wall 
above the trash can three times with the point of Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 
umbrella. 

The brick Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 had touched quivered — The brick he had touched wriggled — in 
the middle, a small hole appeared — The brick he had touched grew wider 
and wider — a second later they were facing an 
archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway 
onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of 
sight. 

Page | 79 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” 

Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
 grinned at Harry’s amazement. they stepped 
through an 
archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway 
onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of 
sight. Harry looked quickly over Harry 
shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back 
into solid wall. 

The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons 
outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — 
Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — 
Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. 

“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we 
gotta get yer money first.” 

Harry wished Harry had about eight more eyes. Harry 
turned Harry head in every direction as they walked up 
the street, trying to look at everything at once: the 
shops, the things outside they, the people doing they 
shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary 
was shaking A plump woman outside an Apothecary 
 as they passed, saying, 

“Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.” 

A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign 
saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, 
Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about 
Harry age had Several boys of about 
Harry’s age noses pressed against a window 
with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of 
them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest 
ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling 
telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had 
never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of 
bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell 
books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, 
globes of the moon. ... 

“Gringotts,” said Hagrid. 



Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 had reached a snowy white building that 
towered over the other little shops. Standing beside 
its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of 
scarlet and gold, was — 

“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 
walked up the white stone steps toward Hagrid. The 
goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. The 
goblin had a 
swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harrynoticed, very long fingers and feet. The 
goblin bowed as Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 
walked inside. Now Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 were facing a second pair of 
doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon 
Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




: 

Enter, stranger, but take heed 

Of what awaits the sin of greed, 

For those who take, but do not earn, 

Must pay most dearly in those who take turn. 

So if you seek beneath our floors 

A treasure that was never yours, 

Thief, you have been warned, beware 

Of finding more than treasure there. 

“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob yeh’d,” said 
Hagrid. 

A pair of goblins bowed A pair of goblins through its burnished bronze doorsand A pair of goblins were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred 
more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long 
counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in 
brass scales, examining precious stones through 
eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count 
Page | 78 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




leading off a vast marble hall, and yet more goblins were 
showing people in and out of more goblins. Hagrid and Harrymade for a long 
counter. 

“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “our’ve come 
ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” 

“You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” 

“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started 
emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long 
counter, scattering a 
handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of 
numbers. The 
goblin wrinkled The 
goblin nose. Harrywatched The 
goblin on their right weighing a pile of 
rubies as big as glowing coals. 

“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden 
key. 

The 
goblin looked at The 
goblin closely. 

“That seems to be in order.” 

“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor 
Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out 
Hagrid chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault 
seven hundred and thirteen.” 

The 
goblin read a letter here from Professor 
Dumbledore carefully. 

“Very well,” The 
goblin said, handing The 
goblin back to Hagrid, “I will 
have someone take you down to both vaults. 
Griphook!” 

Griphook!” 

 was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had 
crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, 
Hagrid and Harry followed Griphook!” 

 toward one of the 
doors leading off a vast marble hall. 



Page | 82 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred 
and thirteen?” Harry asked. 

“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very 
secret. Hogwarts business. Professor 
Dumbledoretrusted me. 
More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” 

Griphook!” 

 held the door open for he and Harry. Harry, who 
had expected more marble, was surprised. Harry, who 
had expected more marble were 
in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming 
torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were 
little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook!” 

 whistled 
and a small cart came hurtling up little railway tracks on the floor toward 
Harry, who 
had expected more marble. Harry, who 
had expected more marble climbed in Hagrid with some difficulty 
— and were off. 

At first Harry, who 
had expected more marble just hurtled through a maze of twisting 
passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, 
left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. a small cart seemed to know a small cart own way, because 
Griphook!” 

 wasn’t steering. 

Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, 
but Harry kept them wide open. Once, Harry thought Harry saw 
a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted 
around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — them 
plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake 
where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the 
ceiling and floor. 

“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise 
of a small cart, “what’s the difference between a 
stalagmite and a stalactite?” 

“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in Stalagmite’s,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ 
ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be 
sick.”

 did look very green, and when a small cart stopped at 
last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagridgot out and had to lean against the passage wall to stop Hagrid 
knees from trembling. 

Griphook!” 

 unlocked a small door in the passage wall. A lot of green smoke 
came billowing out, and as A lot of green smoke 
 cleared, Harry gasped. 
Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. 
Heaps of little bronze Knuts. 

“All yours,” smiled Hagrid. 

Stalagmite’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t 
have known about this or they’d have had The Dursleys from ’dfaster than blinking. How often had they complained 
how much Harry cost they to keep? And all the time 
there had been a small fortune belonging to Harry, 
buried deep under London. 

Hagrid helped Harry pile some of Hagrid into a bag. 

“The gold ones are Galleons,” Harry explained. 

“Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine 
Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should 
be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest 
safe for Harry.” Harry turned to Griphook!” 

. “Vault seven 
hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go 
more slowly?” 

“One speed only,” said Griphook!” 

. 

They were going even deeper now and gathering 
speed. The air became colder and colder as They 
hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over 
an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the 
side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, 
but Hagrid groaned and pulled Harry back by the scruff 
of Harry neck. 



Page | 84 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. 

“Stand back,” said Griphook!” 

 importantly. Griphook!” 

 stroked 
the door gently with one of Griphook!” 

 long fingers and the door 
simply melted away. 

“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, anyone but a Gringotts goblin’d be 
sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said 
Griphook!” 

. 

“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” 
Harry asked. 

“About once every ten years,” said Griphook!” 

 with a 
rather nasty grin. 

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this 
top security vault, Harry was sure, and Harry leaned 
forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at 
the very least — but at first Harry thought it was empty. 
Then Harry noticed a grubby little package wrapped up 
in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked a grubby little package wrapped up 
in brown paper lying on the floor up 
and tucked a grubby little package wrapped up 
in brown paper lying on the floor deep inside Hagrid coat. Harry longed to 
know what a grubby little package wrapped up 
in brown paper lying on the floor was, but knew better than to ask. 

“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to 
me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth 
shut,” said Hagrid. 



One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the 
sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where 
to run first now that Harry had a bag full of money. Harry 
didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to 
a pound to know that Harry was holding more money 
than he’d had in Harry whole life — more money than 
even Dudley had ever had. 



Page | 85 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding 
toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. 
“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a 
pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them 
Gringotts carts.” Harry did still look a bit sick, so Harryentered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. 

Madam Malkin’s was a squat, smiling witch dressed all 
in mauve. 

“Hogwarts, dear?” Madam Malkin’s said, when Harry started to 
speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being 
fitted up just now, in fact.” 

In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed 
face was standing on a footstool while a second witch 
pinned up a second witch 
 long black robes. Madam Malkin’s stood 
Harry on a stool next to Madam Malkin’s, slipped a long robe over 
Madam Malkin’s head, and began to pin a long robe to the right length. 

“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. 

“— Father buying my books and mother’s 
up the street looking at wands,” said a boy with a pale. a boy with a pale had 
a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag a bored, drawling voice 
off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years 
can’t have a bored, drawling voice own. I think I’ll bully father into 
getting me one and I’ll smuggle 
 in somehow.” 

Harry was strongly reminded of even Dudley. 

“Have you got your own broom?” a boy with a pale went on. 

“No,” said Harry. 

“Play Quidditch at all?” 



Page | 86 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth 
Quidditch could be. 

“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to 
play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know 
my House my House you 11 be in yet?” 

“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. 

“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do 
they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family 
have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d 
leave, wouldn’t you?” 

“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing Harry could say something a 
bit more interesting. 

“I say, look at that man!” said a boy with a pale suddenly, 
nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was 
standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two 
large ice creams to show Hagrid couldn’t come in. 

“Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know 
something a boy with a pale didn’t. “Hagrid works at Hogwarts.” 

“Oh,” said a boy with a pale, “I’ve heard of a boy with a pale. a boy with a pale’s a sort of 
servant, isn’t a boy with a pale?” 

“a boy with a pale’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. a boy with a pale was liking a boy with a pale less and less every second. 

“Yes, exactly. I heard a boy with a pale’s a sort of savage — lives in a 
hut on the school grounds and every now and then a boy with a pale 
gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire 
to a boy with a pale bed.” 

“I think Hagrid’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly. 



Page | 87 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he 
with you? Where are your parents?” 

“your parents’re dead,” said Harry shortly. he didn’t feel 
much like going into the matter with a boy with a pale. 

“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. 
“But your parents were our kind, weren’t your parents?” 

“your parents were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you 
mean.” 

“I really don’t think your parents should let the other sort in, 
do you? your parents’re just not the same, your parents’ve never been 
brought up to know our ways. Some of your parents have 
never even heard of Hogwarts until Some of them get the letter, 
imagine. I think Some of them should keep it in the old 
wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?” 

But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin’s said, 
“That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for 
an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down 
from the footstool. 

“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the boy. 

Harry was rather quiet as Harry ate the ice cream Hagridhad bought Harry (chocolate and raspberry with 
chopped nuts). 

“What’s up?” said Hagrid. 

“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment 
and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when Harry found a 
bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When 
They had left the shop, Harry said, “Hagrid, whatStalagmite’s 
Quidditch?” 



Page | 88 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little Harry know — 
not knowin’ about Quidditch!” 

“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. Harry told 
Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s. 

“ — and Harry said people from Muggle families shouldn’t 
even be allowed in — ” 

“Yer not from a Muggle family. If Yer not from a Muggle family’d known who yeh 
were — Yer not from a Muggle familygrown up knowin’ yer name if Yer not from a Muggle family 
parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in 
the Leaky Cauldron was like when the Leaky Cauldron saw yeh. 
Anyway, what does Yer not from a Muggle family know about the Leaky Cauldron, some o’ the best 
I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a 
long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what 
she had fer a sister!” 

“So what is Quidditch?” 

“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in 
the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — 
played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four 
balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” 

“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” 

“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says 
Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ” 

“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily. 

“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. 
“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad 
who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.” 

“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” 

“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid. 

Page | 89 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Page | 89 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 bought Harry’s school books in a shop called 
Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to 
the ceiling with books as large as paving stones 
bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in 
covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a 
few books with nothing in postage stamps at all. Even Dudley, 
who never read anything, would have been wild to get 
his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to 
drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses 
(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies 
with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, 
Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor 
Vindictus Viridian. 

“I was trying to find out how to curse even Dudley.” 

“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter 
use magic in the Muggle world except in very special 
circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh 
couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot 
more study before Harry get ter that level.” 

Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, 
either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice 
set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a 
collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the 
Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make 
up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and 
rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the 
floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders 
lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, 
and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While 
Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a 
supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, 
Harry examined silver unicorn horns at 
twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- 
black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). 



Page | 90 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list 
again. 

“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got 
yeh a birthday present.” 

Harry felt Harry go red. 

“You don’t have to — ” 

“I know I don’t have to. Tell Harry what, I’ll get yer 
animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years 
ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, cats 
make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want 
owls, All the kids’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ 
everythin’.” 

Twenty minutes later, All the kids left Eeylops Owl 
Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling 
and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a 
large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep 
with Harry head under Harry wing. Harry couldn’t stop 
stammering Harry thanks, sounding just like Professor 
Quirrell. 

“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect 
you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just 
Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, 
Ollivanders, and Harry gotta have the best wand.” 

A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really 
looking forward to. 

The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold 
letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine 
Wands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded 
purple cushion in the dusty window. 



Page | 91 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of The last shop as A tinkling bell stepped inside. It was a tiny place, 
empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagridsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though Harry had 
entered a very strict library; Harry swallowed a lot of new 
questions that had just occurred to Harry and looked 
instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly 
right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of 
Harry neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here 
seemed to tingle with some secret magic. 

“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. 
Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a 
loud crunching noise and Hagrid got quickly off the 
spindly chair. 

An old man was standing before them, Hagrid wide, pale 
eyes shining like moons through the gloom of The last shop. 

“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly. 

“Ah yes,” said Harry. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be 
seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. 
“You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday 
your mother was in here your mother, buying your mother first wand. Ten 
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. 
her first wand.” 

Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished 
Mr. Ollivander would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. 

“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany 
wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and 
excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say Your fatherfavored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the 
wizard, of course.” 



Page | 92 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Mr. Ollivander had come so close that the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 and Harrywere almost nose to nose. Harry could see Harry 
reflected in those misty eyes. 

“And that’s where ...” 

Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s 
forehead with a long, white finger. 

“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” Mr. Ollivander said 
softly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful 
wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well, 
if I’d known what that wand was going out into the 
world to do. ...” 

Yew shook Yew head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted 
Hagrid. 

“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. 

... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” 

“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid. 

“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it 
in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, 
suddenly stern. 

“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling Hagrid 
feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” Hagrid added 
brightly. 

“But you don’t use the pieces?” said Mr. Ollivander. 

“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed Harry 
gripped Harry pink umbrella very tightly as Harry spoke. 

“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a 
piercing look. “Well, now — Harry Potter. Let me see.” 

Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 pulled a long tape measure with silver markings 
out of Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” 

“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry. 

“Hold out your wand arm. That’s your wand arm.” Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 measured Harryfrom shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder 
to floor, knee to armpit and round Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 . As Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 
measured, Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core 
of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use 
unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the 
heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are 
the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or 
phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will 
never get such good results with another wizard’s 
wand.” 

Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which 
was measuring between Harry nostrils, was doing this 
on this 
 own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the 
shelves, taking down boxes. 

“That will do,” Mr. Ollivander said, and a long tape measurecrumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. 
Potter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon 
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take 
it and give it a wave.” 

Harry took wand and (feeling foolish) waved wand 
around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched wand out of Mr. Ollivander 
hand almost at once. 

“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite 
whippy. Try — ” 

Harry tried — but Harry had hardly raised wandwhen wand, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. 



Page | 94 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a 
half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.” 

Harry tried. And tried. Harry had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands 
was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, 
but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the 
shelves, the happier Mr. Ollivander seemed to become. 

“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the 
perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — 
yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and 
phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” 

Harry took wand. Harry felt a sudden warmth in Harry 
fingers. Harry raised wand above Harry head, brought wand 
swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of 
red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, 
throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagridwhooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, 
bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... 
how curious ... how very curious ...” 

Mr. Ollivander put Harry’s wand back into Harry’s box and wrapped its box 
in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious 



“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” 

Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with Mr. Ollivander pale stare. 

“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. 
Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix 
whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another 
feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed 
that you should be destined for wand when wand 
brother — why, its 
brother gave you that scar.” 



Harry swallowed. 

Page | 95 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed 
how these things happen. wand chooses the 
wizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great 
things from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who- 
Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, 
but great.” 

Harry shivered. Harry wasn’t sure Harry liked Mr. Ollivander too much. Harry paid seven gold Galleons for 
Harry wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed seven gold Galleons from Mr. Ollivander 
shop. 

The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harryand Hagrid made Harry 
and Hagrid way back down Diagon Alley, 
back through the wall, back through the Leaky 
Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as 
they walked down the road; Harry didn’t even notice how 
much people were gawking at they on the 
Underground, laden as much people were with all much people funny- 
shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its 
cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into 
Paddington station; Harry only realized where much people 
were when Hagrid tapped Harry on the shoulder. 

“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” Harry 
said. 

Harry bought Harry a hamburger and much people sat down on 
plastic seats to eat much people. Harry kept looking around. 
Everything looked so strange, somehow. 

“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid. 

Harry wasn’t sure Harry could explain. He’d just had the 
best birthday of Harry life — and yet — Harry chewed a hamburger, trying to find the words. 

“Everyone thinks I’m special,” Harry said at last. “All 
those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor 

Page | 96 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don’t know anything 
about magic at all. How can they expect great things? 
I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m 
famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, 
sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” 

Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard 
and eyebrows Hagrid wore a very kind smile. 

“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. 
Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll 
be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve 
been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll 
have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, 
’smatter of fact.” 

Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take 
Harry back to the Dursleys, then handed Harry an 
envelope. 

“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” Yer ticket fer Hogwarts said. “First o’ September 
— King’s Cross — King’s Cross it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems 
with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll 
know where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.” 

the train that would take 
him back to the Dursleys pulled out of 
Paddington station. Harry wanted to 
watch Hagrid until Harry was out of sight; Harry rose in Harry 
seat and pressed Harry nose against the window, but Harry 
blinked and Hagrid had gone.

THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 

Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. 
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t 
stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle 
Vernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry 
to do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t 
speak to Harry at all. Half terrified, half furious, they 
acted as though any chair with Harry in it were 
empty. Although this was an improvement in many 
ways, this did become a bit depressing after a while. 

Harry kept to the same room, with Harry new owl for 
company. Harry had decided to call her Hedwig, a name 
Harry had found in A History of Magic. Harry school books 
were very interesting. Harry lay on Harry bed reading late 
into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the 
open window as Hedwig pleased. It was lucky that Aunt 
Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because 
Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night 
before Harry went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day 



Page | 98 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



on the piece of paper Harry had pinned to the wall, 
counting down to September the first. 

On the last day of August Harry thought Harry’d better 
speak to Harry aunt and uncle about getting to King’s 
Cross station the next day, so Harry went down to the 
living room where his aunt and uncle were watching a quiz show on 
television. Harry cleared Harry throat to let them know Harry 
was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the 
living room where they were watching a quiz show on 
television. 

“Er — Uncle Vernon?” 

Uncle Vernon grunted to show ” 

Uncle Vernon was listening. 

“Er — Uncle Vernon — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — ” 

 to 
go to Hogwarts.” 

Uncle Vernon grunted again. 

“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” 

Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. 

“Thank you.” 

Harry was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon 
actually spoke. 

“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. 
Magic carpets all got punctures, have Magic carpets all?” 

Harry didn’t say anything. 

“Where is this school, anyway?” 

“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first 
time. Harry pulled Hagrid had given Harry out of 
Harry pocket. 

Page | 99 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I just take the train from platform nine and three- 
quarters at eleven o’clock,” Harry read. 

his aunt and uncle stared. 

“Platform what?” 

“Nine and three-quarters.” 

“Don’t talk rubbish,” said ” 

Uncle Vernon. “There is no 
platform nine and three-quarters.” 

“It’s on my ticket.” 

“Barking,” said ” 

Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of 
them. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take 
you to King’s Cross. we’re going up to London 
tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” 

“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying 
to keep things friendly. 

“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled ” 

Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before 
Dudley goes to Smeltings.” 

Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was 
too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. Harry got up 
and pulled on Harry jeans because Harry didn’t want to 
walk into 
Paddington station in Harry wizard’s robes — Harry’d 
change on the train. Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet 
again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw 
that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then 
paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. 
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been 
loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had 
talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had 
set off. 



Page | 100 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 
They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle 
Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and 
wheeled Harry’s trunk into the station for Harry’s. Harry thought this 
was strangely kind until Uncle 
Vernon stopped dead, 
facing the platforms with a nasty grin on Harry face. 

“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform 
ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the 
middle, but Your platform don’t seem to have built Your platform yet, do 
Your platform?” 

Harry was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic 
number nine over one platform and a big plastic 
number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, 
nothing at all. 

“Have a good term,” said Uncle 
Vernon with an even 
nastier smile. Uncle 
Vernon left without another word. Harryturned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of 
them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. 
What on earth was Harry going to do? Harry was starting to 
attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d 
have to ask someone. 

Harry stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention 
platform nine and three-quarters. a passing guard had 
never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t 
even tell Harry what part of the country it was in, Harry 
started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being 
stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for 
the train that left at eleven o’clock, but a passing guard said 
there wasn’t one. In the end a passing guard strode away, 
muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying 
hard not to panic. According to the large clock over 
the arrivals board, Harry had ten minutes left to get on 
the train to Hogwarts and Harry had no idea how to do it; 
Harry was stranded in the middle of a station with a 
trunk Harry could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard 
money, and a large owl. 

Page | 101 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid must have forgotten to tell Harry something you 
had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to 
get into Diagon Alley. Harry wondered if Harry should get 
out Harry wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s 
stand between platforms nine and ten. 

At that moment a group of people passed just behind 
Harry and Harry caught a few words of what a group of people were 
saying. 

“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” 

Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump 
woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming 
red hair. Each of a plump 
woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming 
red hair was pushing a trunk like 
Harry’s in front of Harry — and they had an owl. 

Heart hammering, Harry pushed Harry cart after they. 
they stopped and so did Harry, just near enough to hear 
what they were saying. 

“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ 
mother. 

“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red- 
headed, who was holding a small girl hand, “a small girl, can’t I go 



“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, 
Percy, you go first.” 

What looked like the oldest boy marched toward 
platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to 
blink in case Harry missed case — but just as the oldest boyreached the dividing barrier between the two 
platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in 
front of Harry and by the time the last backpack had 
cleared away, the oldest boy had vanished. 



Page | 102 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said. 



“I’m FredFred, I’m George,” said the oldest boy. “Honestly, 
woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell 
I’m George?” 

“Sorry, I’m George, dear.” 

“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the oldest boy, and off the oldest boy 
went. the oldest boy twin called after the oldest boy to hurry up, and the oldest boy 
must have done so, because a second later, the oldest boy had 
gone — but how had the oldest boy done His twin? 

Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the 
barrier — the third brother was almost there — and then, quite 
suddenly, the third brother wasn’t anywhere. 

There was nothing else for it. 

“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman. 

“Hello, dear,” the plump woman said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s 
new, too.” 

the plump woman pointed at the last and youngest of the plump woman sons. Ron’s 
 
was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands 
and feet, and a long nose. 

“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — The thing is, I don’t 
know how to — ” 

“How to get onto the platform?” the plump woman said kindly, and 
Harry nodded. 

“Not to worry,” the plump woman said. “All you have to do is walk 
straight at the barrier between platforms nine and 
ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into 
it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if 
you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” 

Page | 103 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Er — okay,” said Harry. 

Ron pushed Ron trolley around and stared at the 
barrier. It looked very solid. 

Ron started to walk toward It. People jostled Ron on 
People way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked 
more quickly. Harry was going to smash right into the 
barrier and then Harry’d be in trouble — leaning forward 
on Harry cart, Ron broke into a heavy run — the barrier 
was coming nearer and nearer — Harry wouldn’t be able 
to stop — his cart was out of control — Ron was a foot 
away — Ron closed Ron eyes ready for the crash — 

It didn’t come ... Ron kept on running ... Ron opened his eyes. 

A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform 
packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts 
Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind Harry and 
saw a wrought-iron archway where the 
barrier had 
been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- 
Quarters on it. Harry had done it. 

Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the 
chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound 
here and there between the 
chattering crowd legs. Owls hooted to one 
another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble 
and the scraping of heavy trunks. 

The first few carriages were already packed with 
students, some hanging out of the window to talk to 
The first few carriages families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed 
Harry cart off down a platform 
packed with people in search of an empty 
seat. Harry passed a round-faced boy who was saying, 
“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” 

“Oh, Neville,” Harry heard the old woman sigh. 



Page | 104 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small 
crowd. 



“Give us a look, Lee, go on.” 

A boy with dreadlocks lifted the lid of a box in A boy with dreadlocks arms, and the 
people around A boy with dreadlocks shrieked and yelled as something 
inside poked out a long, hairy leg. 

Harry pressed on through a small 
crowd until Harry found 
an empty compartment near the end of the train. Harry 
put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and 
heave Harry trunk toward the train door. Harry tried to lift 
it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and 
twice Harry dropped it painfully on Harry foot. 

“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins 
Harry’d followed through the barrier. 

“Yes, please,” Harry panted. 

“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!” 

With the red-haired twins 
’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked 
away in a corner of an empty compartment near the end of the train. 

“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing Harry sweaty hair out of 
Harry eyes. 

“What’s that?” said one of the red-haired twins 
 suddenly, 
pointing at Harry’s lightning scar. 

“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?” 

“Harry is,” said the other twin. “Aren’t you?” Harry added to Harry. 

“What?” said Harry. 

Page | 105 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“ Harry Potter,” chorused the red-haired twins 
. 

“Oh, Harry,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.” 

The two boys gawked at Harry, and Harry felt Harry 
turning red. Then, to Harry relief, a voice came floating 
in through the train’s open door. 

“Fred? I’m George? Are you there?” 

“Coming, a small girl.” 

With a last look at Harry, the red-haired twins 
 hopped off the 
train. 

Harry sat down next to the window where, half 
hidden, Harry could watch the red-haired family on the 
platform and hear what the red-haired twins 
 were saying. the red-haired twins 
 
mother had just taken out Their 
mother handkerchief. 

“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” 

The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but The youngest boy 
grabbed The youngest boy and began rubbing the end of The youngest boy nose. 

“Mom — geroff.” The youngest boy wriggled free. 

“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on The youngest boy nosie?” 
said one of the red-haired twins 
. 

“Shut up,” said Ron. 

“Where’s 
 Percy?” said Their 
mother. 

“The youngest boy’s 
 coming now.” 

The youngest boy came striding into sight. The youngest boy had 
already changed into The youngest boy billowing black Hogwarts 



Page | 106 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge 
on Harry chest with the letter P on it. 

“Can’t stay long, Their 
mother,” The youngest boy said. “I’m up front, the 
prefects have got two compartments to the 
prefects — ” 

“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the red-haired twins 
, 
with an air of great surprise. “You should have said 
something, we had no idea.” 

“Hang on, I think I remember The youngest boy saying something 
about it,” said the other twin. “Once — ” 

“Or twice — ” 

“A minute — ” 

“All summer — ” 

“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect. 

“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one 
of the red-haired twins 
. 

“Because Percy’s a prefect,” said Their 
mother fondly. “All 
right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl 
when you get there.” 

She kissed Percy on the cheek and Percy left. Then She 
turned to the red-haired twins 
. 

“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I 
get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up 
a toilet or — ” 

“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” 
“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.” 



Page | 107 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.” 

“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with We.” 

“Shut up,” said Ron again. Ron was almost as tall as 
the red-haired twins 
 already and Ron nose was still pink where 
Their 
mother had rubbed his nose. 

“Hey, a small girl, guess what? Guess who we just met on 
the train?” 

Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see Harry 
looking. 

“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in 
the station? Know who black-haired boy who was near us in 
 is?” 

“Who?” 

“ Harry Potted” 

Harry heard the little girl’s voice. 

“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see black-haired boy who was near us in 
, Mom, 
oh please. ...” 

“You’ve already seen black-haired boy who was near us in 
, Ginny, and the poor boy 
isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is black-haired boy who was near us in 
 really, 
Fred? How do you know?” 

“Asked black-haired boy who was near us in 
. Saw black-haired boy who was near us in 
 scar. It’s really there — like 
lightning.” 

“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. he 
was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the 
platform.” 

“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what 
You-Know-Who looks like?” 

Page | 108 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Their 
mother suddenly became very stern. 



“I forbid you to ask he, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As 
though he needs reminding of that on he first day at 
school.” 

“All right, keep your hair on.” 

A whistle sounded. 

“Hurry up!” Their 
mother said, and the three boys 
clambered onto the train. their leaned out of the 
window for her to kiss their good-bye, and their 
younger sister began to cry. 

“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” 

“Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” 

“ Georg e\” 

“Only joking, a small girl.” 

the train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother 
waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, 
running to keep up with the train until the train gathered too 
much speed, then the boys’ mother 
 fell back and waved. 

Harry watched the girl and the boys’ mother 
 mother disappear as 
the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the 
window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. Harry 
didn’t know what Harry was going to — but He 
 had to be 
better than what Harry was leaving behind. 

The door of the compartment slid open and the 
youngest redheaded boy came in. 

“Anyone sitting there?” the 
youngest redheaded boy asked, pointing at a Hogwarts toilet seat. “Everywhere else is full.” 

Page | 109 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry shook Harry head and the 
youngest redheaded boy sat down. Harry 
glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the 
window, pretending the 
youngest redheaded boy hadn’t looked. Harry saw Harry 
still had a black mark on Harry nose. 

“Hey, Ron.” 

The twins were back. 

“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — 

Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” 

“Right,” mumbled Ron. 

Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce 
we? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, 
we brother. See you later, then.” 

“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the 
compartment door shut behind The twins. 

“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out. 

Harry nodded. 

“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and 
Lee Jordan’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — 
you know ...” 

Ron pointed at Harry’s forehead. 

Harry pulled back Harry bangs to show the lightning 
scar. Ron stared. 

“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” 

“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly. 

Page | 110 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing 
else.” 



“Wow,” said Ron. Ron sat and stared at Harry for a few 
moments, then, as though Ron had suddenly realized 
what Ron was doing, Ron looked quickly out of the 
window again. 

“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found 
Ron just as interesting as Ron found Ron. 

“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a 
second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk 
about an accountant.” 

“So you must know loads of magic already.” 

The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding 
families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked 
about. 

“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. 
“What are they like?” 

“Horrible — well, not all of they. My aunt and uncle 
and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard 
brothers.” 

“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, Ron was looking 
gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. 
You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and 
Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and 
Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a 
prefect. Fred and I’m George mess around a lot, but Fred and George 
still get really good marks and everyone thinks Fred and George’re 
really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the 
others, but if I do, as well’s no big deal, because Everyone did no big deal 
first. You never get anything new, either, with five 

Page | 111 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Now Percy’s a 
prefect old wand, 
and Percy’s old rat.” 

Ron reached inside Ron jacket and pulled out a fat 
gray rat, which was asleep. 

“Ron name’s Scabbers and Ron’s useless, Ron hardly ever 
wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being 
made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got 
Scabbers instead.” 

Ron’s ears went pink. Percy seemed to think Percy’d said 
too much, because Percy went back to staring out of the 
window. 

Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not 
being able to afford an owl. After all, Harry’d never had 
any money in Harry life until a month ago, and Harry told 
Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s 
 old clothes 
and never getting proper birthday presents. This 
seemed to cheer Ron up. 

"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything 
about being a wizard or about my parents or 
Voldemort — ” 

Ron gasped. 

“What?” said Harry. 

“ You said You-Know-Who’s name\” said Ron, sounding 
both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, 
of all people — ” 

“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the 
name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. 
See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,” he 
added, voicing for the first time something that had 



Page | 112 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




been worrying 112 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in 
the class.” 

“You won’t be. ThereNow Percy’s a 
prefect loads of people who come from 
Muggle families and There’s loads of people who come from 
Muggle families learn quick enough.” 

While There’s loads of people who come from 
Muggle families had been talking, the train had carried 
There’s loads of people who come from 
Muggle families out of London. Now There’s loads of people who come from 
Muggle families were speeding past 
fields full of cows and sheep. There’s loads of people who come from 
Muggle families were quiet for a 
time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. 

Around half past twelve there was a great clattering 
outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman 
slid back a smiling, dimpled woman 
 door and said, “Anything off the cart, 
dears?” 

Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to Harry feet, 
but Ron’s ears went pink again and Ron muttered that 
Ron’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. 

Harry had never had any money for candy with the 
Dursleys, and now that Harry had pockets rattling with 
gold and silver Harry was ready to buy Mars Bars as Harry could carry — but a smiling, dimpled woman 
 didn’t have 
Mars Bars. What a smiling, dimpled woman 
 did have were Now Percy’s a 
prefect 
Every Flavor Beans, Bertie Bott’s 
 Best Blowing Gum, 
Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, 
Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things 
Harry had never seen in Harry life. Not wanting to miss 
anything, Harry got some of everything and paid a smiling, dimpled woman 
 eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. 

Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the 
compartment and tipped the 
compartment onto an empty seat. 

“Hungry, are you?” 



Page | 113 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a 
pumpkin pasty. 

Ron had taken out a lumpy package and a lumpy packagea lumpy package. There were four sandwiches inside. Ron pulled one 
of four sandwiches apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t 
like corned beef.” 

“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a 
pasty. “Go on — ” 

“You don’t want this, this’s all dry,” said Ron. “She 
hasn’t got much time,” Ron added quickly, “you know, 
with five of us.” 

“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had 
anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share 
it with. it was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, 
eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, 
and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). 

“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a 
pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are 
They?” Harry was starting to feel that nothing would 
surprise Harry. 

“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing 
Agrippa.” 

“What?” 

“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs 
have cards inside Frogs 
, you know, to collect — 
famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five 
hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.” 

Harry unwrapped Harry Chocolate Frog and picked up 
the card. his Chocolate Frog showed a man’s face. a man’s face wore half-moon 
glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver 

Page | 114 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture 
was the name Albus Dumbledore. 



“So this is Albus Dumbledore!” said Harry. 

“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Albus Dumbledore!” said 
Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get — thanks 


Harry turned over the card and read: 

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 

CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS 

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern 
times, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore 
defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the 
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon 
work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel. 
Albus Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten 
pin bowling. 

Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry 
astonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had 
disappeared. 

“Albus Dumbledoregone!” 

“Well, you can’t expect Albus Dumbledore to hang around all day,” 
said Ron. “Albus Dumbledore’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again 
and I’ve got about six of Morgana ... do you want it? You 
can start collecting.” 

Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs 
waiting to be unwrapped. 

“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the 
Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” 

Page | 115 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded 
amazed. “Weird).” 



Harry stared as Albus Dumbledore sidled back into the 
picture on Harry card and gave Harry a small smile. Ronwas more interested in eating the frogs than looking 
at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harrycouldn’t keep Ron’s eyes off the Famous Witches. Soon Harry had not only 
Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, 
Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. Ron 
finally tore Ron’s eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, 
who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie 
Bott’s Every Flavor Beans. 

“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned 
Harry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every 
flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like 
chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then 
you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George 
reckons George 
 had a booger-flavored one once.” 

Ron picked up a green bean, looked at a green bean carefully, 
and bit into a corner. 

“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.” 

Sprouts had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. 
Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, 
curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave 
enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron 
wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. 

The countryside now flying past the window was 
becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there 
were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. 

There was a knock on the door of their compartment 
and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on 

Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




platform nine and three-quarters came in. Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 looked 
tearful. 



“Sorry,” Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” 

When they shook they heads, Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 wailed, “I’ve lost 
Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling

 keeps getting away from Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




!” 

“Hell turn up,” said Harry. 

“Yes,” said Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling

 left. 

“Don’t know why Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d 
brought a toad I’d lose I’d 
brought a toad as quick as I could. Mind 
you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.” 

The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap. 

“Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 might have died and you wouldn’t know the 
difference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling

very battered-looking wand. a 
very battered-looking wand was chipped in places 
and something white was glinting at the end. 

“Unicorn hairNow Percy’s a

 had just raised a 
very battered-looking wand when the compartment 
door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but 
this time The toadless boy had a girl with The toadless boy. a girl was already 
wearing a girl new Hogwarts robes. 

“Has anyone seen a toad? Now Percy’s a 
prefect lost one,” a girl said. 
a girl had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown 
hair, and rather large front teeth. 

Page | 117 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“We’ve already told Now Percy’s a 
prefect We haven’t seen it,” said Ron, 
but a girl wasn’t listening, a girl was looking at a 
very battered-looking wand in Now Percy’s a 
prefect hand. 

“Oh, are you doing magic? LetNow Percy’s a 
prefect see it, then.” 

a girl sat down. Ron looked taken aback. 

“Er — all right.” 

Ron cleared Ron throat. 

“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, 

Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” 

Ron waved a 
very battered-looking wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers 
stayed gray and fast asleep. 

“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said a girl. “Well, 
it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells 
just for practice and itNow Percy’s a 
prefect worked for me. Nobody in 
my familyNow Percy’s a 
prefect magic at all, it was ever such a surprise 
when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of 
course, I mean, my letter’s the very best school of witchcraft 
there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books 
by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I“ 
Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” 

Hermione Granger said all this very fast. 

Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by Harry 
stunned face that Harry hadn’t learned all the course 
books by heart either. 

“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered. 

“Harry Potter,” said Harry. 



Page | 118 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about 
you, of course — I got a few extra books for 
background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical 
History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and 
Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” 

“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed. 

“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out 
everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do 
either of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been 
asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds 
by far the best; I hear Albus Dumbledore was in it, 
but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ... 
Anyway, we’d better go and look for Now Percy’s a 
prefect toad. 

You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll 
be there soon.” 

And she left, taking the toadless boy with she. 

“Whatever what House I’m in, I hope she’s not in what House,” said 
Ron. Ron threw a 
very battered-looking wand back into his trunk. “Stupid 
spell — George 
 gave it to George 
, bet George 
 knew it was a 
dud.” 

“what House what House are your brothers in?” asked Harry. 

Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling 
on Ron again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t 
know what Mom and Dad’ll say if ’m. I don’t suppose 
Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if Mom and Dad put 
me in Slytherin.” 

“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was 
in?” 



“Yeah,” said Ron. Ron flopped back into Ron seat, 
looking depressed. 



Page | 119 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are 
a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off 
Houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that 
your oldest brothers’ve left, anyway?” 

Harry was wondering what a wizard did once Harry’d 
finished school. 

“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in 
Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did 
you hear about Gringotts? ItNow Percy’s a 
prefect been all over the Daily 
Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the 
Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security 
vault.” 

Harry stared. 

“Really? What happened to them?” 

“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t 
been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful 
Dark wizard to get GringottsGringotts, but They don’t 
think They took anything, that’s “Charlie’s in Romania odd. ’Course, 
everyone gets scared when something like this 
happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” 

Harry turned this news over in Harry mind. Harry was 
starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know- 
Who was mentioned. Harry supposed this was all part of 
entering the magical world, but this had been a lot more 
comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying. 

“WhatNow Percy’s a 
prefect your Quidditch team?” Ron asked. 

“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed. 

“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it“Charlie’s in Romaniathe best game in the world — ” And Ron was off, 
explaining all about the four balls and the positions of 

Page | 120 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the seven players, describing famous games Ron’d been 
to with Ron brothers and the broomstick Ron’d like to 
get if Ron had the money. Ron was just taking Harrythrough the finer points of the game when the 
compartment door slid open yet again, but the 
compartment door wasn’t 
Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this 
time. 

Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle 
one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s 
robe shop. the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s 
robe shop was looking at Harry with a lot more 
interest than the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s 
robe shop’d shown back in Diagon Alley. 

“Is it true?” the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s 
robe shop said. “Three boys’re saying all down the train 
that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So all down the train 
that Harry Potter’s in this compartment’s you, is 
all down the train 
that Harry Potter’s in this compartment?” 



“Yes,” said Harry. the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s 
robe shop was looking at Three boys. 
Both of Three boys were thickset and looked extremely 
mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, Both of them 
looked like bodyguards. 

“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale 
boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. 

“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” 

Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been 
hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at Ron. 

“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who 
you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red 
hair, freckles, and more children than they can 
afford.” 

My father turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some 
wizarding families are much better than others, 

Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the 
wrong sort. I can help you there.” 



Page | 121 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




My father held out My father hand to shake “Charlie’s in Romania, but Harrydidn’t take his hand. 

“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for My father, 
thanks,” My father said coolly. 

Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared 
in Draco Malfoy pale cheeks. 

“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” My father said slowly. 
“Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as 
your parents. your parents didn’t know what was good for 
your parents, either. You hang around with riffraff like the 
Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” 

Both Harry and Ron stood up. 

“Say that again,” Ron said, Ron face as red as Ron hair. 

“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Draco Malfoysneered. 

“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely 
than Harry felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot 
bigger than Harry or Ron. 

“But us don’t feel like leaving, do us, boys? us’ve 
eaten all us food and you still seem to have some.” 

Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to 
Ron leapt forward, but before Ron’d so much as 
touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. 

Scabbers the rat was hanging off Scabbers finger, sharp 
little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe 
and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbersround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally 
flew off and hit the window, all three of — Crabbe 
and Malfoy 
disappeared at once. Perhaps — Crabbe 
and Malfoy thought there were 
Page | 122 “Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps 
— Crabbe 
and Malfoy’d heard footsteps, because a second later, 
Hermione Granger had come in. 

“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the 
sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbersby Ron tail. 

“I think RonNow Percy’s a 
prefect been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. 

Ron looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it 
— Now Percy’s a 
prefect gone back to sleep.” 

And so Ron had. 

“You’ve met Draco Malfoy before?” 

Harry explained about — Crabbe 
and Malfoy meeting in Diagon Alley. 

“I’ve heard of Harry family,” said Ron darkly. “— Crabbe 
and Malfoy were 
some of the first to come back to — Crabbe 
and Malfoy side after You- 
Know-Who disappeared. Said — Crabbe 
and Malfoy’d been bewitched. 
My dad doesn’t believe it. My dad says Draco Malfoyfather 
didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” My dad 
turned to Hermione. “Can — Crabbe 
and Malfoy help you with 
something?” 

“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve 
just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and the conductor 
says — Crabbe 
and Malfoy’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, 
have you? You’ll be in trouble before — Crabbe 
and Malfoy even get 
there!” 

Scabbers has been fighting, not — Crabbe 
and Malfoy,” said Ron, 
scowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while — Crabbe 
and Malfoy 
change?” 

“All right — I only came in here because people 
outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and 
down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. 

Page | 123 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you 
know?” 



Ron glared at her as her left. Harry peered out of the 
window. It was getting dark. Harry could see mountains 
and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did 
seem to be slowing down. 

Ron, 
 took off Ron, 
 jackets and pulled on Ron, 
 . “Charlie’s in Romania were a bit short for Ron, you 
could see Ron sneakers underneath Ron, 
. 

A voice echoed through The train: “Ron, 
 will be reaching 
Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your 
luggage on The train, The train will be taken to the school 
separately.” 

Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, Ron 
saw, looked pale under Ron freckles. They crammed 
They pockets with the last of the sweets and joined 
the crowd thronging the corridor. 

The train slowed right down and finally stopped. 
People pushed People way toward the door and out on 
to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold 
night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads 
of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: 
“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, 
Harry?” 

Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. 

“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer 
step, now! Firs’ years follow me!” 

Slipping and stumbling, ” 

Slipping and stumbling followed Hagrid’s down 
what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so 
dark on either side of ” 

Slipping and stumbling that Harry thought there 
must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. 

Page | 124 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Neville, the boy who kept losing Harry Potter toad, sniffed once 
or twice. 



“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid 
called over Hagrid 
 shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” 

There was a loud “Oooooh!” 

The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge 
of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain 
on the other side, the other side windows sparkling in the starry 
sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. 

“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid’s called, pointing to 
a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. 
Harry and Ron were followed into Harry and Ron boat by Neville 
and Hermione. 

“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to 
himself. “Right then — FORWARD!” 

And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, 
gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as 
glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great 
castle overhead. It towered over Everyone as Everyone sailed 
nearer and nearer to the cliff on which It stood. 

“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid’s as the first boats reached 
the cliff; they all bent they all heads and the little boats 
carried they all through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide 
opening in the cliff face. they all were carried along a 
dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking they all right 
underneath the great 
castle overhead, until they all reached a kind of 
underground harbor, where they all clambered out onto 
rocks and pebbles. 

“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who 
was checking the boats as people climbed out of 
the boats. 

Page | 125 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Trevor!” cried Neville 
 blissfully, holding out his 
hands. Then they all clambered up a passageway in the 
rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto 
smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the great 
castle overhead. 

they all walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded 
around the huge, oak front door. 

“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?” 

Hagrid’s raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times 
on front door.

THE SORTING HAT 

front door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired 
witch in emerald-green robes stood there. A tall, black-haired 
witch in emerald-green robes had a 
very stern face and “Charlie’s in Romania first thought was that this 
was not someone to cross. 

“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid’s. 

“Thank you, Hagrid’s. I will take Hagrid’s from here.” 

A tall, black-haired 
witch in emerald-green robes pulled front door wide. The entrance hall was so 
big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ 
house in The entrance hall. The stone walls were lit with flaming 
torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too 
high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase 
facing flaming 
torches like the ones at Gringotts led to the upper floors. 

flaming 
torches like the ones at Gringotts followed Professor McGonagall across the 
flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of 
hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the 
rest of the school must already be here — but 
Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a 
small, empty chamber off The entrance hall. flaming 
torches like the ones at Gringotts crowded in, 
Page | 127 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 



standing rather closer together than flaming 
torches like the ones at Gringotts would 
usually have done, peering about nervously. 

“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. 
“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but 
before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will 
be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very 
important ceremony because, while you are here, 
your House will be something like your family within 
Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your 
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free 
time in your House common room. 

“your Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, 
Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. House House has House own 
noble history and each has produced outstanding 
witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your 
triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- 
breaking will lose House points. At the end of the 
year, the House with the most points is awarded the 
House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a 
credit to whichever House becomes yours. 

“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few 
minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest 
you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can 
while you are waiting.” 

Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, 
which was fastened under Neville’s left ear, and on “Charlie’s in Romaniasmudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten Harry 
hair. 

“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said 
Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.” 

Professor McGonagall left the chamber. Harry swallowed. 



Page | 128 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“How exactly do they sort we into Houses?” he asked 
Ron. 



“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but 
I think Fred was joking.” 

Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of 
the whole school? But Fred didn’t know any magic yet 
— what on earth would Fred have to do? Fred hadn’t 
expected something like this the moment they 
arrived. Fred looked around anxiously and saw that 
everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking 
much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering 
very fast about all the spells No one’d learned and 
wondering which one No one’d need. Harry tried hard not 
to listen to No one. He’d never been more nervous, never, 
not even when Harry’d had to take a school report home 
to the Dursleys saying that Harry’d somehow turned Harry 
teachers wig blue. Harry kept Harry eyes fixed on the door. 
Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come 
back and lead Professor McGonagall to Professor McGonagall doom. 

Then something happened that made Professor McGonagall jump about 
a foot in the air — several people behind Professor McGonagall 
screamed. 

“What the — ?” 

Professor McGonagall gasped. So did the people around Professor McGonagall. About 
twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back 
wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, About 
twenty ghosts 
glided across the room talking to one another and 
hardly glancing at the first years. they 
 seemed to be 
arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was 
saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give 
a fat little monk a second chance — ” 

“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the 
chances a fat little monk deserves? a fat little monk gives us all a bad name and 

Page | 129 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




you know, a fat little monk’s not really even a ghost — I say, what 
are you all doing here?” 



A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly 
noticed the first years. 

Nobody answered. 

“New students!” said My dear Friar, smiling around at 
New students. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?” 

A few people nodded mutely. 

“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said My dear Friar. “My old 
House, you know.” 

“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting 
Ceremony’s about to start.” 

Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, About 
twenty ghosts floated away through the back 
wall. 

“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first 
years, “and follow me.” 

Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, 
Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with 
Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, 
back across the hall, and through a pair of double 
doors into the Great Hall. 

Harry had never even imagined such a strange and 
splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands 
of candles that were floating in midair over four long 
tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. 
four long 
tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. 
 were laid with glittering golden plates 
and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long 
table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they 
Page | 130 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




came to a halt in a line facing the other students, 
with the teachers behind the other students. The hundreds of faces 
staring at the other students looked like pale lanterns in the 
flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among 
the students, About 
twenty ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to 
avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and 
saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. Harry heard 
Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky 
outside. I read about It in Hogwarts, A History.” 

It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, 
and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the 
heavens. 

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor 
silently placed a four-legged stool in front 
of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed 
wizard’s hat. a pointed 
wizard’s hat was patched and frayed and 
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let a pointed 
wizard’s hat in 
the house. 

Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of a rabbit, Harrythought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — 
noticing that everyone in the Great Hall was now staring at 
a pointed 
wizard’s hat, Harry stared at a pointed 
wizard’s hat, too. For a few seconds, there 
was complete silence. Then a pointed 
wizard’s hat twitched. A rip 
near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and a pointed 
wizard’s hat began to sing: 

“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, 

But don’t judge on what you see, 

I’ll eat Harry if you can find 

A smarter hat than Harry. 

You can keep your bowlers black, 



Page | 131 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Your top hats sleek and tall, 

For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat 
And I can cap Your top hats. 

There’s nothing hidden in your head 
a pointed 
wizard’s hat can’t see, 

So try me on and I will tell you 
Where you ought to be. 

You might belong in Gryffindor, 

Where dwell the brave at heart, 

Their daring, nerve, and chivalry 
Set Gryffindors apart; 

You might belong in Hufflepuff, 

Where Their are just and loyal, 

Those patient Hufflepuffs are true 
And unafraid of toil; 

Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, 

If you’ve a ready mind, 

Where those of wit and learning, 

Will always find those of wit and learning kind; 

Or perhaps in Slytherin 

Page | 132 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




You’ll make your real friends, 

Those cunning folk use any means 
To achieve Those cunning folk ends. 

So put me on! Don’t be afraid l\ 

And don’t get in a flap\ 

You’re in safe hands (though I have none) 

For I’m a Thinking Cap\” 

The whole hall burst into applause as a pointed 
wizard’s hat finished 
The whole hall song. The whole hall bowed to each of the four tables and then 
became quite still again. 

“So we’ve just got to try on a pointed 
wizard’s hat!” Ron whispered to HarryHarry. “I’ll kill Fred, Fred was going on about wrestling 
a troll.” 

Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on a pointed 
wizard’s hat was a lot 
better than having to do a spell, but Fred did wish they 
could have tried a pointed 
wizard’s hat on without everyone watching. a pointed 
wizard’s hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel 
brave or quick-witted or any of a pointed 
wizard’s hat at the moment. If 
only the hat had mentioned a House for people who 
felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for 
him. 

Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a 
long roll of parchment. 

“When I call your name, you will put on a pointed 
wizard’s hat and 
sit on the stool to be sorted,” Professor McGonagall said. “Abbott, 
Hannah!” 



Page | 133 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of 
line, put on the hat, which fell right down over A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtailseyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause — 

Hufflepuff!” shouted a pointed 
wizard’s hat. 

The table on the right cheered and clapped as 
Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. 

Harry saw the ghost of My dear Friar waving merrily at 
her. 

“Bones, Susan!” 

Hufflepuff!” shouted a pointed 
wizard’s hat again, and Susanscuttled off to sit next to Hannah. 

“Boot, Terry!” 

“RAVENCLAW!” 

the Hufflepuff table second from the left clapped this time; 
several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with 
Terry as 
Terry joined several Ravenclaws. 

“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but 
“Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, 
and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; 
Harry could see “Charlie’s in Romania twin brothers catcalling. 

“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. 
Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all Harry’d 
heard about Slytherin, but Harry thought they looked 
like an unpleasant lot. 

Harry was starting to feel definitely sick now. Harry 
remembered being picked for teams during gym at Harry 
old school. Harry had always been last to be chosen, not 
because Harry was no good, but because no one wanted 
Dudley to think they liked Harry. 

Page | 134 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” 



“HUFFLEPUFF!” 

Sometimes, Harry noticed, a pointed 
wizard’s hat shouted out the 
House at once, but at others the 
House took a little while to 
decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy 
next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a 
whole minute before a pointed 
wizard’s hat declared him a 
Gryffindor. 

“Granger, Hermione!” 

Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed a pointed 
wizard’s hateagerly on Hermione head. 

“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted a pointed 
wizard’s hat. Ron groaned. 

A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts 
always do when you’re very nervous. What if Harry 
wasn’t chosen at all? What if Harry just sat there with 
the hat over Harry eyes for ages, until Professor 
jerked it off Harry head and said there had 
obviously been a mistake and Harry’d better get back on 
the train? 

When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his 
toad, was called, his fell over on his way to the stool. 
a pointed 
wizard’s hat took a long time to decide with his. When 
a pointed 
wizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still 
wearing a pointed 
wizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter 
to give a pointed 
wizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” 

Malfoy swaggered forward when ” 

Malfoy name was called 
and got ” 

Malfoy wish at once: a pointed 
wizard’s hat had barely touched 
” 

Malfoy when a pointed 
wizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” 

Malfoy went to join ” 

Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, 
looking pleased with ” 

Malfoy. 

Page | 135 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




There weren’t many people left now. 



“Moon” , “Nott” ... , “Parkinson” ... , then a pair of 
twin girls, “Path” and “Path” ... , then “Perks, Sally- 
Anne” . . . , and then, at last — 

“Potter, Harry!” 

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke 
out like little hissing fires all over the hall. 

“ Potter , did Anne” say?” 

“ “ Potter?” 

The last thing Harry saw before a pointed 
wizard’s hat dropped over 
Harry eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a 
good look at Harry. Next second Harry was looking at the 
black inside of a pointed 
wizard’s hat. Harry waited. 

“Hmm,” said a small voice in Harry ear. “Difficult. Very 
difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind 
either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a 
nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ... 
So where shall I put you?” 

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not 
Slytherin, not Slytherin. 

“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you 
sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in 
your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to 
greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re 
sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” 

Harry heard a pointed 
wizard’s hat shout the last word to the whole 
hall. Harry took off a pointed 
wizard’s hat and walked shakily toward 
the Gryffindor table. Harry was so relieved to have been 
chosen and not put in Slytherin, Harry hardly noticed 

Page | 136 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




that Harry was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the 
Prefect got up and shook Harry hand vigorously, while 
the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Harry Potter! We got 
Harry Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff 
Harry’d seen earlier. the ghost in the ruff 
 patted the ghost in the ruff 
 arm, giving 
Harry the sudden, horrible feeling the ghost in the ruff 
’d just plunged his arm 
into a bucket of ice-cold water. 

the ghost in the ruff 
 could see the High Table properly now. At the end 
nearest the ghost in the ruff 
 sat Hagrid, who caught the ghost in the ruff 
 eye and gave 
the ghost in the ruff 
 the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, 
in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, 
sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized Albus Dumbledore at once 
from the card Albus Dumbledore’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on 
the train. Albus Dumbledore silver hair was the only thing 
in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. 
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous 
young man from the Leaky Cauldron. Harry was looking 
very peculiar in a large purple turban. 

And now there were only four people left to be sorted. 
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, 
joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” 
became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. Ron 
was pale green by now. Harry crossed Harry fingers 
under the table and a second later a pointed 
wizard’s hat had 
shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” 

Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed 
into a large gold chair next to Harry. 

“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley 
pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was 
made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up Professor McGonagall 
scroll and took a pointed 
wizard’s hat away. 

Harry looked down at Harry empty gold plate. Harry had 
only just realized how hungry Harry was. The pumpkin 
pasties seemed ages ago.

Albus Dumbledore had gotten to Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Albus Dumbledore feet. Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Albus Dumbledore was 
beaming at the students, Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Albus Dumbledore arms opened wide, as if 
nothing could have pleased Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Albus Dumbledore more than to see 
them all there. 

“Welcome!” Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Albus Dumbledore said. “Welcome to a new year at 
Hogwarts! Before we begin we banquet, I would like 
to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! 

Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! 

“Thank you!” 

Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Albus Dumbledore sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. 
Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. 

“Is Harry — a bit mad?” Harry asked Percy uncertainly. 

“Mad?” said Percy airily. “Harry’s a genius! Best wizard 
in the world! But Harry is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, 
Harry?” 

Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of Harry 
were now piled with food. Harry had never seen so many 
things Harry liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast 
chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, 
bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, 
fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, 
ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint 
humbugs. 

The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but 
The Dursleys’d never been allowed to eat as much as The Dursleys liked. 
Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really 
wanted, even if it made Harry sick. Harry piled Harry plate 
with a bit of everything except the peppermints and 
began to eat. It was all delicious. 

“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, 
watching Harry cut up Harry steak. 

Page | 138 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Can’t you — ?” 



“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said 
the ghost in the ruff 
. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does 
miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced Harry? Sir 
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. 
Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” 

“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My 
brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless 
Nick!” 

“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— ” the ghost in the ruff 
 began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus 
Finnigan interrupted. 

“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?” 

Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— looked extremely miffed, as if their little 
chat wasn’t going at all the way Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— wanted. 

“Like this,” Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— said irritably. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— seized Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— left ear and 
pulled. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— whole head swung off Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— neck and fell 
onto Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— shoulder as if his shoulder was on a hinge. Someone 
had obviously tried to behead Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
—, but not done Someone 
 
properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on 
their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped Nearly Headless Nick head 
back onto Nearly Headless Nick , coughed, and said, “So — new 
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the 
House Championship this year? Gryffindors have 
never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have 
got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s 
becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin 
ghost.” 

Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a 
horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a 
gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. Harry 
was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to 

Page | 139 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating 
arrangements. 

“How did Harry get covered in blood?” asked Seamus 
with great interest. 

“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nearly Headless Nickdelicately. 

When everyone had eaten as much as everyone could, the 
remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving 
everyone sparkling clean as before. A moment later the 
desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor 
you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate 
eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- 
0, rice pudding ... 

As Harry helped Harry to a treacle tart, the talk 
turned to their families. 

“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus 
. “Me dad’s a Muggle. 
Mom didn’t tell ’s a Muggle. 
 Mom was a witch ’til after they 
were married. Bit of a nasty shock for ’s a Muggle. 
.” 

The others laughed. 

“What about you, Neville?” said Ron. 

“Well, Gran brought me up and Mom’s a witch,” 
said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle 
for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me 
off my guard and force some magic out of me — My Great Uncle Algie 
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly 
drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. 
My Great Uncle Algie Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and My Great Uncle Algie was 
hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles 
when my Great Auntie Enid offered My Great Uncle Algie a meringue 
and My Great Uncle Algie accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the 
way down the garden and into the road. — all the 
way down the garden and into the road were all 
Page | 140 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




really pleased, Gran was crying, Gran was so happy. 
And you should have seen — all the 
way down the garden and into the road faces when I got in 
here — — all the 
way down the garden and into the road thought I might not be magic enough to 
come, you see. My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” 

On he’s the Slytherin 
ghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione 
were talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione 
 start right 
away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly 
interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning 
something into something else, of course, it’s 
supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting 
small, just matches into needles and that sort of 
thing — ”). 



Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, 
looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was 
drinking deeply from Hagrid goblet. Professor McGonagallwas talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor 
Quirrell, in Professor 
Quirrell absurd turban, was talking to a 
teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and 
sallow skin. 

It happened very suddenly. a 
teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and 
sallow skinlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s 
eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on 
Harry’s forehead. 

“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to Harry head. 

“What is it?” asked Percy. 

“N-nothing.” 

The pain had gone as quickly as The pain had come. Harder 
to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the 
teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at 
all. 



Page | 141 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Who’s that teacher talking to Quirrell?” he 
asked Percy. 

“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder 
Quirrell’s looking so nervous, he’s the Slytherin 
ghost. Quirrell 
teaches Potions, but Quirrell doesn’t want to — everyone 
knows Quirrell’s he’s the Slytherin 
ghost . Knows an awful lot 
about the Dark Arts, Snape.” 

Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t 
look at Snape again. 

At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor 
Quirrellgot to Professor Dumbledore again. The hall fell silent. 

“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all 
fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to 
give you. 

“First years should note that the forest on the 
grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our 
older students would do well to remember that as 
well.” 

Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction 
of the Weasley twins. 

“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to 
remind you all that no magic should be used between 
classes in the corridors. 

“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of 
the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House 
teams should contact Madam Hooch. 

“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- 
floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds 
to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful 
death.” 

Page | 142 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry laughed, but the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 was one of the few who did. 



“the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




’s not serious?” the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 muttered to Percy. 

“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Professor Dumbledore. “Ithe’s the Slytherin 
ghostodd, because he’s the Slytherin 
ghost usually gives us a reason why we’re 
not allowed to go somewhere — he’s the Slytherin 
ghost, everyone knows that. I do think he’s the Slytherin 
ghost 
might have told us prefects, at least.” 

“And now, before us go to bed, let us sing the school 
song!” cried Professor Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other 
teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed. 

Professor Dumbledore gave Professor Dumbledore wand a little flick, as if Professor Dumbledore was 
trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden 
ribbon flew out of he was 
, which rose high above the tables 
and twisted he was 
, snakelike, into words. 

“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, 
“and off we go!” 

And the school 
 bellowed: 

“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, 

Teach we something please, 

Whether we be old and bald 
Or young with scabby knees, 

we heads could do with filling 
With some interesting stuff, 

For now Our heads’re bare and full of air, 

Dead flies and bits of fluff, 

Page | 143 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




So teach we things worth knowing, 

Bring back what we’ve forgot, 

Just do your best, we’ll do the rest, 

And learn until we brains all rot.” 

Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, 
only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a 
very slow funeral march. Professor Dumbledore conducted only the Weasley twins 
last few lines with his wand and when only the Weasley twins had 
finished, Professor Dumbledore was one of those who clapped loudest. 

“Ah, music,” Professor Dumbledore said, wiping Professor Dumbledore eyes. “A magic 
beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you 
trot!” 

The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the 
chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the 
marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, 
but only because Percy was so tired and full of food. Percy 
was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in 
the portraits along the corridors whispered and 
pointed as the people in 
the portraits along the corridors passed, or that Percy Percy led the people in 
the portraits along the corridors 
through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and 
hanging tapestries. the people in 
the portraits along the corridors climbed more staircases, 
yawning and dragging the people in 
the portraits along the corridors feet, and Harry was just 
wondering how much farther the people in 
the portraits along the corridors had to go when 
the people in 
the portraits along the corridors came to a sudden halt. 

A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair 
ahead of the people in 
the portraits along the corridors, and as Percy took a step toward the people in 
the portraits along the corridors 
the people in 
the portraits along the corridors started throwing the people in 
the portraits along the corridors at Percy. 

“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A 
poltergeist.” Percy raised Percy voice, “Peeves — show 
yourself.” 



Page | 144 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a 
balloon, answered. 

“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” 

There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark 
eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- 
legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. 

“Oooooooh!” the Bloody Baron said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle 
Firsties! What fun!” 

the Bloody Baron swooped suddenly at the walking sticks. the walking sticks ducked. 

“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I 
mean this!” barked Percy. 

Peeves stuck out Peeves tongue and vanished, dropping 
the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard Peeves 
zooming away, rattling coats of armor as Peeves passed. 

“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as 
they set off again. “the Bloody Baron’s the only one 
who can control the Bloody Baron, the Bloody Baron won’t even listen to us 
prefects. Here us are.” 

At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a 
very fat woman in a pink silk dress. 

“Password?” a 
very fat woman said. 

“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and a portrait of a 
very fat woman swung 
forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all 
scrambled through a round hole in the wall — Neville needed a leg up — 
and found They all 
 in the Gryffindor common 
room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. 

Percy directed the girls through one door to the girls 
dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of 

Page | 145 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the 
towers — they found they beds at last: five four- 
posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. five four- 
posterstrunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk 
much, Their 
trunks pulled on five four- 
posters pajamas and fell into bed. 

“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through 
the hangings. “Get off Scabbers! Ron’s chewing my 
sheets.” 

Harry was going to ask Ron if Ron’d had any of the 
treacle tart, but Harry fell asleep almost at once. 

Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because Harry 
had a very strange dream. Harry was wearing Professor 
Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling 
Harry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it 
was Harry destiny. Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want 
to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried 
to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there 
was Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — 
then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, 
Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there 
was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating 
and shaking. 

Harry rolled over and fell asleep again, and when Harry 
woke next day, Harry didn’t remember the dream at all. 



Page | 146 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






THE POTIONS MASTER 

“There, look.” 

“Where?” 

“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” 

“Wearing the glasses?” 

“Did you see Harry face?” 

“Did you see Harry scar?” 

Whispers followed Harry from the moment Harry left Harry 
dormitory the next day. People lining up outside 
classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at Harry, or 
doubled back to pass Harry in the corridors again, 
staring. Harry wished People lining up outside 
classrooms wouldn’t, because Harry was 
trying to concentrate on finding Harry way to classes. 

There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at 
Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; 
some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some 

Page | 147 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 



with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to 
remember to jump. Then there were doors that 
wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled 
doors that 
wouldn’t open unless you asked politely in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t 
really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It 
was also very hard to remember where anything was, 
because it all seemed to move around a lot. The 
people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, 
and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. 

The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty 
shock when one of The ghosts glided suddenly through a 
door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick 
was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the 
right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth 
two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met Nick 
 
when you were late for class. Nick 
 would drop 
wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from 
under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak 
up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, 
“GOT YOUR CONK!” 

Even worse than Peeves the Poltergeist, if that was possible, was the 
caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get 
on the wrong side of Harry on Harry and Ron very first morning. 
Argus Filch found Harry and Ron trying to force Harry and Ron way through a 
door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to 
the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. Argus Filch 
wouldn’t believe Harry and Ron were lost, was sure Harry and Ron were 
trying to break into it on purpose, and was 
threatening to lock Harry and Ron in the dungeons when Harry and Ron 
were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. 

Argus Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust- 
colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like 
Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule 
in front of She, put just one toe out of line, and she’d 
whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two 
seconds later. Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of 
Page | 148 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




the school 
 better than anyone (except perhaps the 
Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any 
of The ghosts. The students all hated anyone (except perhaps the 
Weasley twins), and it was 
the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a 
good kick. 

And then, once you had managed to find them, there 
were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to 
magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving his wand and saying a few funny words. 

They had to study the night skies through They 
telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn 
the names of different stars and the movements of the 
planets. Three times a week They went out to the 
greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, 
with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, 
where They learned how to take care of all the strange 
plants and fungi, and found out what They were used 
for. 

Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, 
which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor 
Binns had been very old indeed when Professor 
Binns had fallen 
asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next 
morning to teach, leaving Professor 
Binns body behind Professor 
Binns. Professor 
Binnsdroned on and on while They scribbled down names 
and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the 
Oddball mixed up. 

Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny 
little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to 
see over his desk. At the start of their first class his 
took the roll call, and when his reached Harry’s name 
his gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. 

Professor 
Binns was again different. Harry had 
been quite right to think Professor 
Binns wasn’t a teacher to

cross. Strict and clever, Professor 
Binns gave Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




cross a talking- to 
the moment Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




cross sat down in Professor 
Binns first class. 

“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and 
dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” Professor 
Binns 
said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave 
and not come back. You have been warned.” 

Then Professor 
Binns changed his desk into a pig and back again. 
Anyone messing around in my class were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get 
started, but soon realized Anyone messing around in my class weren’t going to be 
changing the furniture into animals for a long time. 
After taking a lot of complicated notes, Anyone messing around in my class were each 
given a match and started trying to turn a match into a 
needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione 
Granger had made any difference to only Hermione 
Granger match; 
Professor 
Binns showed my class how my class had 
gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare 
smile. 

The class everyone had really been looking forward to 
was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s 
lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. Quirrell’s 
 classroom 
smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to 
ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was 
afraid would be coming back to get Quirrell’s 
 one of these 
days. Quirrell’s 
 , Quirrell’s 
 told them, had been given to Quirrell’s 
 
by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of 
a troublesome zombie, but them weren’t sure them 
believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus 
Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had 
fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started 
talking about the weather; for another, them had 
noticed that a funny smell hung around Quirrell’s turban, 
and the Weasley twins insisted that Quirrell was stuffed full 
of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected 
wherever Quirrell went.

Harry was very relieved to find out that Harry wasn’t 
miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come 
from Muggle families and, like Harry, hadn’t had any 
idea that Lots of people were witches and wizards. There was so 
much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have 
much of a head start. 

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. Harry and Ron 
finally managed to find Harry and Ron way down to the Great 
Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. 

“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as Ron 
poured sugar on Ron porridge. 

“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. 
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always 
favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” 

“Professor 
Binns favored us,” said Harry. Professor 
Binns was head of Gryffindor House, but Professor 
Binns 
hadn’t stopped Professor 
Binns from giving them a huge pile of 
homework the day before. 

Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to 
this by now, but the mail had given Harry a bit of a shock on 
the first morning, when about a hundred owls had 
suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during 
breakfast, circling the tables until about a hundred owls saw about a hundred owls 
owners, and dropping letters and packages onto about a hundred owls 
laps. 

Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. Hedwig 
sometimes flew in to nibble Harry ear and have a bit of 
toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the 
other school owls. This morning, however, She 
fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar 
bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harrytore Harry’s plate open at once. Harry said, in a very untidy scrawl: 



Page | 151 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dear Harry, 



I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like 
to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? 

I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an 
answer back with Hedwig. 

Harry Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see 
you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off 
again. 

It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look 
forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to 
be the worst thing that had happened to Harry so far. 

At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the 
idea that Professor Snape disliked Harry. By the end of 
the first Potions lesson, Harry knew Harry’d been wrong. 
Professor Snape didn’t dislike Harry — Professor Snape hated Harry —. 

Potions lessons took place down in one of the 
dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main 
castle, and would have been quite creepy enough 
without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all 
around the walls. 

Professor Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the 
roll call, and like Flitwick, Professor Snape paused at Harry’s name. 

“Ah, yes,” Professor Snape said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — 
celebrity.” 

Draco Malfoy and Draco Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle 
sniggered behind their hands. Professor Snape finished calling 
the names and looked up at the class. Professor Snape eyes were 
black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s 

Page | 152 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




warmth. 152 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




warmth were cold and empty and made you 
think of dark tunnels. 

“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art 
of potion-making,” he began. he spoke in barely more 
than a whisper, but 152 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




warmth caught every word — like 
Professor 
Binns, Professor Snape had the gift of keeping a 
class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish 
wand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe 
this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand 
the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its 
shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that 
creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, 
ensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle 
fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t 
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to 
teach.” 

More silence followed this little speech. Harry and 
Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. only Hermione 
Granger was on the edge of only Hermione 
Granger seat and looked 
desperate to start proving that only Hermione 
Granger wasn’t a 
dunderhead. 

“Harry Potter!” said Professor Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I 
added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of 
wormwood?” 

Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harryglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as Harry was; 
Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air. 

“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. 

Professor Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer. 

“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” 

Tut ignored Hermione ’s hand. 

Page | 153 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Let’s try again. “Harry Potter, where would you look if I told 
you to find me a bezoar?” 

Hermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it 
would go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. Harrytried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who 
were shaking with laughter. 

“I don’t know, sir.” 

“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, 
eh, “Harry Potter?” 

Harry forced Harry to keep looking straight into 
those cold eyes. Harry had looked through Harry books at 
the Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember 
everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and 
Fungi ? 

Professor Snape was still ignoring ’s quivering hand. 

“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood 
and wolfsbane?” 

At this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching 
toward the dungeon ceiling. 

“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” 

A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, 
and Seamus winked. Professor Snape, however, was not 
pleased. 

“Sit down,” Professor Snape snapped at Hermione. “For your 
information, “Harry Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a 
sleeping potion so powerful a 
sleeping potion is known as the 
Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken 

Page | 154 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




from the stomach of a goat and a goat will save you from 
most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they 
are the same plant, which also goes by the name of 
aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?” 

There was a sudden rummaging for quills and 
parchment. Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point 
will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, 
Potter.” 

Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the 
Potions lesson continued. Professor Snape put them all into 
pairs and set 
pairs to mixing up a simple potion to 
cure boils. Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, 
watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake 
fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, 
whom Professor Snape seemed to like. Professor Snape was just telling everyone 
to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed Professor Snape 
horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a 
loud hissing filled the dungeon. Professor Snape had somehow 
managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted 
blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone 
floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within 
seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools 
while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as 
angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs. 

“Idiot boy!” snarled Professor Snape, clearing their potionaway with one wave of Professor Snape wand. “I suppose you 
added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron 
off the fire?” 

Professor Snape whimpered as boils started to pop up all over 
Professor Snape nose. 

“Take Professor Snape up to the hospital wing,” Professor Snape spat at 
Seamus. Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who 
had been working next to Professor Snape. 

Page | 155 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell You — Potter — not to add 
the porcupine quills? Thought You — Potter —’d make you look good if You — Potter — got 
it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for 
Gryffindor.” 

This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to 
argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron. 

“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can 
turn very nasty.” 

As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour 
later, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were 
low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in Harry’s very 
first week — why did Professor Snape hate Professor Snape so much? 

“Cheer up,” said Ron, Seamus’s always taking points 
off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid 
with you?” 

At five to three five to three left the main 
castle and made five to three way 
across the grounds. Hagrid 
 lived in a small wooden 
house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow 
and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. 

When Harry knocked A crossbow 
and a pair of galoshes heard a frantic scrabbling 
from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid 
voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” 

Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry 
pulled the door open. 

“Hang on,” Harry said. “Back, Fang.” 

Harry let Back, Fang.” 

 in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar 
of an enormous black boarhound. 

There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants 
were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was 

Page | 156 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a 
massive bed with a patchwork quilt over a 
massive bed. 

“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid 
, letting go of 
Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started 
licking Ron ears. Like Hagrid 
, Fang was clearly not as 
fierce as Fang looked. 

“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring 
boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock 
cakes onto a plate. 

“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s 
freckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers 
away from the forest.” 

The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins 
that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all 
about Harry and Ron 
 first lessons. Fang rested Fang head on 
Harry’s knee and drooled all over Fang robes. 

Harry and Ron 
 were delighted to hear Hagrid 
 call 
Filch “that old git.” 

“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce 
her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up 
ter the school, her follows me everywhere? Can’t get 
rid of her puts her up to it.” 

Harry told Hagrid 
 about Professor Snape’s lesson. Hagrid 
, like RonRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Professor Snapeliked hardly any of the students. 

“But Professor Snape seemed to really hate me.” 

“Rubbish!” said Hagrid 
. “Why should Professor Snape?” 



Page | 157 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid 
 didn’t 
quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that. 

“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid 
 asked Ron. “I 
liked Ron a lot — great with animals.” 

Harry wondered if Hagrid 
 had changed the subject on 
purpose. While Ron told Hagrid 
 all about Charlie’s 
work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper 
that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was 
a cutting from the Daily Prophet : 

GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST 

Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts 
on 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark 
wizards or witches unknown. 

Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had 
been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact 
been emptied the same day. 

“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep 
your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said 
a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. 

Harry remembered Ron telling Harry on the train that 
someone had tried to rob Gringotts 
, but Ron hadn’t 
mentioned the date. 

Hagrid 
!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in 
happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening 
while we were there!” 

There was no doubt about It, Hagrid 
 definitely didn’t 
meet Harry’s eyes this time. Harry grunted and offered 
Harry another rock cake. Harry read the story again. 

The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied 
earlier that same day. Hagrid 
 had emptied vault seven 
Page | 158 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, 
taking out that grubby little package. Had that been 
what the thieves were looking for? 

As Harry and Ron 
 walked back to the main 
castle for 
dinner, Harry and Ron 
 pockets weighed down with rock cakes 
Harry and Ron 
’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that 
none of the lessons he’d had so far had given Harry as 
much to think about as tea with Hagrid 
. Had Hagrid 
collected that grubby little package just in time? Where was that grubby little package 
now? And did Hagrid 
 know something about Snape 
that Snape 
 didn’t want to tell Harry?

THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 

Harry had never believed Harry would meet a boy Harry 
hated more than Dudley, but that was before Harry met 
Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had 
Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put 
up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until 
they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor 
common room that made them all groan. Flying 
lessons would be starting on Thursday — and 
Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. 

“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always 
wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in 
front of Malfoy.” 

Harry had been looking forward to learning to fly more 
than anything else. 

“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” 
said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always 
going on about how good Malfoy is at Quidditch, but I bet 
thatSeamus’s all talk.” 

Page | 160 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 



Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. Malfoycomplained loudly about first years never getting on 
the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful 
stories that always seemed to end with Malfoy narrowly 
escaping Muggles in helicopters. Malfoy wasn’t the only 
one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, Malfoy’d 
spent most of Malfoy childhood zooming around the 
countryside on a broomstick in 
front of Malfoy. Even Ron would tell 
anyone who’d listen about the time Ron’d almost hit a 
hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from 
wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. 
Ron had already had a big argument with Dean 
Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. 
Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with 
only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harryhad caught Ron prodding Seamus’s poster of West Ham 
soccer team, trying to make the players move. 

Professor Snape had never been on a broomstick in Professor Snape life, 
because Professor Snape grandmother had never let Professor Snape near one. 
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because 
Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of 
accidents even with both feet on the ground. 

Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about 
flying as Professor Snape was. This was something you couldn’t 
learn by heart out of a book — not that Harry hadn’t 
tried. At breakfast on Thursday Harry bored them all 
stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library 
book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Professor Snape was 
hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything 
that might help him hang on to him later, 
but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s 
lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. 

Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, 
something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of 
course. Charlie’s 
 eagle owl was always bringing Malfoy ’s eagle owlPage | 161 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




packages of sweets from home, which Harry opened 
gloatingly at the Slytherin table. 

A barn owl brought Professor Snape a small package from Professor Snape 
grandmother. Professor Snape opened a small package from his 
grandmother excitedly and showed 
them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which 
seemed to be full of white smoke. 

“a small package from his 
grandmother’s the 
Remembrall!” Professor Snape explained. “a small package from his 
grandmother knows I 
forget things — this tells you if there’s something 
you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this 
and if this 
 turns red — oh ...” Professor Snape face fell, because the 
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “... you’ve 
forgotten something ...” 

Professor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten 
when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor 
table, snatched the 
Remembrall out of Professor Snape hand. 

Harry and Ron 
 jumped to Harry and Ron 
 feet. Harry and Ron 
 were half 
hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor 
McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any 
teacher in the school, was there in a flash. 

“What’s going on?” 

“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” 

Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the 
Remembrallback on the table. 

“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with 
Crabbe and Goyle behind he. 

At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the 
other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto 
the grounds for Ron, and the 
other Gryffindors first flying lesson. It was a clear, 
breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as 
their marched down the sloping lawns toward a 
Page | 162 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds 
to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying 
darkly in the distance. 

the Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty 
broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harryhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about 
the school brooms, saying that some of Fred and George Weasley started 
to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly 
to the left. 

Fred and George Weasley teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, 
gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. 

“Well, what are you all waiting for?” She barked. 
“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry 
up.” " 

Harry glanced down at Harry broom. It was old and 
some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. 

“Stick out your right hand over his broom,” called 
Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ” 

“UP!” everyone shouted. 

his broom jumped into Harry hand at once, but his broom 
was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had 
simply rolled over on the ground, and Hermione Granger’s hadn’t 
moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell 
when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a 
quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that 
Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground. 

Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount them 
brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up 
and down the rows correcting them grips. Harry and 
Ron were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been 
doing Malfoy wrong for years. 

Page | 163 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the 
ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep their 
brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight 
back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle 
— three — two — ” 

But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of 
being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the 
whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips. 

“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising 
straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve 
feet — twenty feet. Harry saw Harry scared white face 
look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, 
slip sideways off his broom and — 

WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay 
facedown on the grass in a heap. Harry broomstick was 
still rising higher and higher, and started to drift 
lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. 

Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as 
white as Madam Hooch. 

“Broken wrist,” Harry heard Madam Hooch mutter. “Come on, 
boy — it’s all right, up you get.” 

Madam Hooch turned to the rest of the class. 

“None of you is to move while I take boy to the 
hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are 
or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 
‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” 

Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, 
hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm 
around his.

No sooner were Page | 164 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 out of earshot than Malfoy burst 
into laughter. 

“Did you see his face, the great lump?” 

the Slytherins joined in. 

“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil. 

“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy 
Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought 
you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” 

“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching 
something out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing 
Longbottom’s gran sent It’s that stupid thing 
.” 

the 
Remembrall glittered in the sun as It’s that stupid thing 
 held the 
Remembrall up. 

“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone 
stopped talking to watch. 

Malfoy smiled nastily. 

“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find 
— how about — up a tree?” 

“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto 
Harry broomstick and taken off. Harry hadn’t been lying, Harry 
could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost 
branches of an oak Harry called, “Come and get Hovering level with the topmost 
branches of an oak he called, 
Potter!” 

Harry grabbed his broom. 

“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told 
us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.”

Harry up a 
little to take 
his broomstick even higher, and heard screams and 
gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring 
whoop from Ron. 

Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry turned Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry sharply to face Malfoy in 
midair. Malfoy looked stunned. 

“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off his broom!” 

“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking 
worried. 

Harry knew, somehow, what to do. Harry leaned forward 
and grasped his broom tightly in both hands, and his broom 
shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got 
out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- 
face and held the broom steady. A few people below 
were clapping. 

“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, 
Malfoy,” Harry called. 

The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. 

“Catch it if you can, then!” Harry shouted, and Harry threw 
the glass ball high into the air and streaked back 
toward the ground. 

Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the glass ball high into the air rise up 
in the air and then start to fall. Harry leaned forward 
and pointed his broom handle down — next second 

Page | 166 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball 
— wind whistled in Harry ears, mingled with the 
screams of people watching — Harry stretched out Harry 
hand — a foot from the ground Harry caught a foot, just in 
time to pull his broom straight, and Harry toppled gently 
onto the grass with the 
Remembrall clutched safely in 
Harry fist. 

“HARRY POTTER!” 

Harry heart sank faster than Harry’d just dived. Professor 
McGonagall was running toward them. Professor 
McGonagall got to Professor 
McGonagall 
feet, trembling. 

“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” 

Professor 
McGonagall was almost speechless with 
shock, and Professor 
McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare 
you — might have broken your neck — ” 

“It wasn’t Professor 
McGonagall fault, Professor — ” 

“Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” 

“But Malfoy — ” 

“That’s enough, George Weasley. Harry Potter, follow me, now.” 

Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s 
triumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in 
Hermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the 
castle. Hermione Granger’s was going to be expelled, Hermione Granger’s just knew it. 

Hermione Granger’s wanted to say something to defend Hermione Granger’s, but 
there seemed to be something wrong with Hermione Granger’s voice. 
Professor 
McGonagall was sweeping along without 
even looking at Professor 
McGonagall; Professor 
McGonagall had to jog to keep up. Now 
Professor 
McGonagall’d done it. Professor 
McGonagall hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be 
packing Professor 
McGonagall bags in ten minutes. What would the 
Dursleys say when Professor 
McGonagall turned up on the doorstep? 
Page | 167 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, 
and still Professor 
McGonagall Professor 
McGonagall didn’t say a word to 
Professor 
McGonagall. Hermione Granger’s wrenched open doors and marched along 
corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind Hermione Granger’s. 
Maybe Hermione Granger’s was taking Professor 
McGonagall to Dumbledore. Professor 
McGonagall 
thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as 
gamekeeper. Perhaps Professor 
McGonagall could be Hermione Granger’s assistant. 
Professor 
McGonagall stomach twisted as Professor 
McGonagall imagined it, watching Ronand the others becoming wizards while Professor 
McGonagall stumped 
around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag. 

Professor 
McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. 
Professor 
McGonagall opened the door and poked Professor 
McGonagall head inside. 

“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood 
for a moment?Wood 
? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane 
Professor 
McGonagall was going to use on Harry? 

But Wood 
 turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year 
boy who came out of Professor Flitwick’s class looking 
confused. 

“Follow me, you two,” said Professor 
McGonagall, and 
they marched on up the corridor, Wood 
 looking 
curiously at Harry. 

“In here.” 

Professor 
McGonagall Professor 
McGonagall pointed they into a classroom 
that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy 
writing rude words on the blackboard. 

“Out, Peeves!” Professor 
McGonagall barked. Peeves threw the chalk 
into a bin, which clanged loudly, and Peeves swooped out 
cursing. Professor 
McGonagall slammed the door 
behind Professor 
McGonagall and turned to face the two boys. 



Page | 168 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry Potter, this is Wood 
. Wood — I’ve found you a 
Seeker.” 

Wood 
’s expression changed from puzzlement to 
delight. 

“Are you serious, Professor 
?” 

“Absolutely,” said Professor 
McGonagall Professor 
McGonagall crisply. “The 
boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like The 
boy’s a natural. Was 
that your first time on a broomstick, Harry Potter?” 

Harry nodded silently. Harry didn’t have a clue what was 
going on, but Harry didn’t seem to be being expelled, and 
some of the feeling started coming back to Harry legs. 

“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot 
dive,” Professor 
McGonagall told Wood 
. “Didn’t even 
scratch Professor 
McGonagall. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done 
it.” 

Wood 
 was now looking as though all Charlie Weasley dreams had 
come true at once. 

“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Harry Potter?” Charlie Weasley asked 
excitedly. 

“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor 
McGonagall Professor 
McGonagall explained. 

“Charlie Weasley’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now 
walking around Harry and staring at Harry. “Light — 
speedy — we’ll have to get Harry a decent broom, 
Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a 
Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” 

“I shall speak to Dumbledore and see if we 
can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need 
a better team than last year. Flattened in that last 

Page | 169 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in 
the face for weeks. ...” 

Professor 
McGonagall peered sternly over Professor 
McGonagall glasses 
at Harry. 

“I want to hear you’re training hard, Harry Potter, or I may 
change my mind about punishing you.” 

Then Professor 
McGonagall suddenly smiled. 

“Your father would have been proud,” Professor 
McGonagall said. “Your father 
was an excellent Quidditch player himself.” 

“You’re joking.” 

It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ronwhat had happened when Harry’d left the grounds with Professor 
McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and 
kidney pie halfway to Ron mouth, but Ron’d forgotten all 
about a piece of steak. 

“Seeker?” Ron said. “But first years never — you must 
be the youngest House player in about — ” 

“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. Harry felt particularly hungry after the 
excitement of the afternoon. “Wood 
 told me.” 

Ron was so amazed, so impressed, Ron just sat and 
gaped at Harry. 

“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t 
tell anyone, Wood 
 wants to keep Wood 
 a secret.” 

Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, 
spotted Harry, and hurried over. 



Page | 170 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood 
 told Fred and George Weasley. 
Fred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” 

“I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for 
sure this year,” said Fred. “Fred and George Weasley haven’t won since 
Charlie Weasley left, but this year’s team is going to be 
brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood 
 was almost 
skipping when Wood 
 told Fred and George Weasley.” 

“Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood 
 reckons Wood 
The 
boy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” 

“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the 
Smarmy that we found in we first week. See you.” 

Fred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when 
someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked 
by Crabbe and Goyle. 

“Having a last meal, Harry Potter? When are you getting the 
train back to the Muggles?” 

“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the 
ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” 
said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all 
little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table 
was full of teachers, neither of teachers could do more 
than crack teachers knuckles and scowl. 

“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. 
“Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — 
no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a 
Wizard’s duel before, I suppose?” 

“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m 
he second, who’s yours?” 

Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing Crabbe and Goyle up. 



Page | 171 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? Well meet you 
in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” 

When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each 
other. 

“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do 
you mean, you’re my second?” 

“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said 
Ron casually, getting started at last on Ron cold pie. 
Catching the look on Harry’s face, Harry added quickly, 
“But people only die in proper duels, you know, with 
real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do 
is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows 
enough magic to do any real damage. I bet Harry 
expected you to refuse, anyway.” 

“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” 

“Throw it away and punch ” 

 on the nose,” Ronsuggested. 

“Excuse me.” 

They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. 

“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron. 

Hermione ignored Ron and spoke to Harry. 

“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoywere saying — ” 

“Bet you could,” Ron muttered. 

“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school 
at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if 



Page | 172 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very 
selfish of you.” 

“And It’s really none of your business,” said Harry. 
“Good-bye,” said Ron. 

All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end 
to the day, Harry thought, as Harry lay awake much later 
listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville 
wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent 
all evening giving Ron advice such as “If Ron tries to 
curse you, you’d better dodge he tries to 
curse you, because I can’t 
remember how to block he tries to 
curse you.” There was a very good 
chance he tries to 
curse you were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. 
Norris, and Harry felt Harry was pushing Harry luck, 
breaking another school rule today. On the other 
hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of 
the darkness — this was his big chance to beat 
Malfoy face-to-face. his couldn’t miss it. 

“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better 
go.” 

They pulled on They bathrobes, picked up They 
wands, and crept across the tower room, down the 
spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common 
room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, 
turning all the armchairs into hunched black 
shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole 
when a voice spoke from the chair nearest They, “I 
can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” 

A lamp flickered on. A lamp was Hermione Granger, 
wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. 

“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!” 



Page | 173 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, 

“Percy — your brother’s a prefect, your brother’d put a stop to this.” 

Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. 

“Come on,” Harry said to Ron. Harry pushed open the 
portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the portrait hole 
. 

Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. Hermione 
followed Ron through the portrait hole 
, hissing at 
them like an angry goose. 

“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care 
about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the 
House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor 
McGonagall for knowing about Switching 
Spells.” 

“Go away.” 

“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what 
I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, 
you’re so — ” 

But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermionehad turned to the 
portrait of the Fat Lady the Fat Lady to get back 
inside and found Hermione facing an empty painting. 

the Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and 
Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. 

“Now what am I going to do?” the Fat Lady asked shrilly. 

“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, 
We’re going to be late.” 

They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor 
when Hermione caught up with They. 

“I’m coming with the Fat Lady,” the Fat Lady said. 

Page | 174 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You are not.” 



“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for 
Filch to catch me? If Filch finds all three of us I’ll tell 
Filch the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you 
can back me up.” 

“You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly. 

“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard 
something.” 

It was a sort of snuffling. 

“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the 
dark. 

It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville 
. Neville 
 was curled up 
on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake 
as they crept nearer. 

“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for 
hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get 
in to bed.” 

“Keep your voice down, Neville 
. The password’s ‘Pig 
snout’ but Pig 
 won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone 
off somewhere.” 

“How’s your arm?” said Harry. 

“Fine,” said Neville 
, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey 
mended it in about a minute.” 

“Good — well, look, Neville 
, we’ve got to be 
somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” 



Page | 175 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t leave me!” said Neville 
, scrambling to Neville 
 feet, 

“I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” 

Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at 
Hermione and Neville. 

“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve 
learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us 
about, and used it on you.” 

Hermione opened Hermione mouth, perhaps to tell Ronexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harryhissed at Hermione to be quiet and beckoned them all 
forward. 

them all 
 flitted along corridors striped with bars of 
moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harryexpected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but them all 
 
were lucky. them all 
 sped up a staircase to the third floor 
and tiptoed toward the trophy room. 

Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal 
trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught 
Malfoy and Crabbe. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver 
and gold in the darkness. Malfoy and Crabbe edged along the walls, 
keeping Malfoy and Crabbe eyes on the doors at either end of the 
room. Harry took out Harry wand in case Malfoy leapt in 
and started at once. The minutes crept by. 

“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered. 

Then a noise in the 
room made them jump. 

Harry had only just raised his wand when them heard 
someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy. 

“Sniff around, my sweet, “Sniff around, my sweet might be lurking in a 
corner.” 



Page | 176 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris?”. Horror-struck, 
Harry waved madly at the other three to follow Harry as 
quickly as possible; “Sniff around, my sweet scurried silently toward the 
door, away from the Fat Lady’s voice. the Fat Lady’s robes had 
barely whipped round a 
corner when Neville’s robes heard 
Filch enter the trophy room. 

“Neville’s robes’re in here somewhere,” Neville’s robes heard Harry mutter, 
“probably hiding.” 

“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, 
petrified, the others began to creep down a long gallery full 
of suits of armor. the others could hear Filch getting 
nearer. Neville 
 suddenly let out a frightened squeak 
and broke into a run — Neville 
 tripped, grabbed Ronaround the waist, and the pair of Neville’s robes toppled right 
into a suit of armor. 

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the 
whole castle. 

“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted 
down a long gallery full 
of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether 
Filch was following — they swung around the 
doorpost and galloped down one corridor then 
another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where 
they were or where they were going — they ripped 
through a tapestry and found they in a hidden 
passageway, hurtled along a hidden 
passageway and came out near they 
Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from 
the trophy room. 

“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against 
the cold wall and wiping him forehead. Neville 
 was 
bent double, wheezing and spluttering. 

“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the 
stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” 



Page | 177 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, 
“quickly as possible.” 

Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You 
realize that, don’t you? Harry was never going to meet 
you Filch knew someone was going to be in the 
trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped someone off.” 

Harry thought Harry was probably right, but Harry wasn’t 
going to tell Harry that. 

“Let’s go.” 

It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone 
more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled 
and something came shooting out of a classroom in 
front of They. 

It was Peeves. Harry caught sight of They and gave a 
squeal of delight. 

“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown 
out.” 

Peeves cackled. 

“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, 
tut, Tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” 

“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” 

“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity 
voice, but Peeves eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your 
own good, you know.” 

“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at 
Peeves — this was a big mistake. 



Page | 178 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, 
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS 
CORRIDOR!” 

Ducking under Peeves, they ran for they lives, right 
to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a 
door — and it was locked. 

“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at 
the door, “We’re done for! This is the end!” 

they could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as Filch 
could toward the Fat Lady’s shouts. 

“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed 
Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 
“Alohomora\” 

the lock clicked and the door swung open — they 
piled through the lock, shut the lock quickly, and pressed they 
ears against the lock, listening. 

“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. 
“Quick, tell me.” 

“Say ‘please.’ ” 

“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?” 

“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said 
Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. 

“All right — please.” 

“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing 
if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they 
heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filchcursing in rage. 



Page | 179 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Page | 179 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 thinks the door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I 
think well be okay — get off Neville 
!” For Neville 
 had 
been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the 
last minute. “What?” 

Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. 
For a moment, Harry was sure Harry’d walked into a 
nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything 
that had happened so far. 

They weren’t in a room, as Harry had supposed. They 
were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third 
floor. And now They knew why The forbidden corridor on the third 
floor was forbidden. 

They were looking straight into the eyes of a 
monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space 
between ceiling and floor. The forbidden corridor on the third 
floor had three heads. Three 
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and 
quivering in They direction; three drooling mouths, 
saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. 

It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at They, 
and Harry knew that the only reason They weren’t 
already dead was that They sudden appearance had 
taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over 
that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous 
growls meant. 

Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and 
death, Harry’d take Filch. 

They fell backward Harry Harry slammed the door shut, 
and They ran, They almost flew, back down a corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for They 
somewhere else, because They didn’t see Filch 
anywhere, but they did hardly cared — all they did wanted to 
do was put as much space as possible between they did 
and that monster. they did didn’t stop running until they did 



Page | 180 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh 
floor. 

“Where on earth have you all been?” the Fat Lady asked, 
looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders 
and their flushed, sweaty faces. 

“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted 
Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They 
scrambled into the common room and collapsed, 
trembling, into armchairs. 

It was a while before any of They said anything. 
Neville 
, indeed, looked as if Neville 
’d never speak again. 

“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing 
like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If 
any dog needs exercise, that one does.” 

Hermione had got both Hermione breath and Hermione bad 
temper back again. 

“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” Hermione 
snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” 

“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at it 
feet, I was too busy with it .” 

“No, not the floor. not the floor was standing on a trapdoor. not the floorthe Fat Lady’sobviously guarding something.” 

Hermione stood up, glaring at them. 

“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all 
have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you 
don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” 

Ron stared after Hermione, Ron mouth open. 



Page | 181 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“No, We don’t mind,” Ron said. “You’d think We dragged 
Hermione along, wouldn’t you?” 

But Hermione had given Harry something else to 
think about as Ron climbed back into bed. The dog was 
guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? 
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for 
something you wanted to hide — except perhaps 
Hogwarts. 

Gringotts looked as though Harry had found out where the 
grubby little package from vault seven hundred and 
thirteen was.

Malfoy saw that 
Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, 
looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the 
next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting 
the three-headed dog had been an excellent 
adventure, and Harry and Ron were quite keen to have another 
one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the 
package that seemed to have been moved from 
Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time 
wondering what could possibly need such heavy 
protection. 

“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said 
Ron. 

“Or both,” said Harry. 

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious 
object was that it was about two inches long, they 
didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was 
without further clues. 

Page | 183 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 



Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest 
interest in what lay underneath the dog and the 
trapdoor. All Neville 
 cared about was never going near 
The dog again. 

Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and 
Ron, but Hermione was such a bossy know-it-all that Harry and 
Ron 
saw this as an added bonus. All Harry and 
Ron really wanted 
now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to Harry and 
Ron 
great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail 
about a week later. 

As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, 
everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, 
thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harrywas just as interested as everyone else to see what 
was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped this large parcel right in front of Harry, 
knocking Harry bacon to the third 
floor. the owls had hardly 
fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a 
letter on top of this large parcel. 

Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, 
because it said: 



DO NOT OPEN this large parcel AT THE TABLE. 

this large parcel contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I 
don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a 
broomstick or the owls’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will 
meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven 
o’clock for your first training session. 

Harry Harry had difficulty hiding Harry glee as Harry handed the 
note to Ron to read.

“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. 
“I’ve never even touched one.” 

They left the Great Hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the 
broomstick in private before They first class, but 
halfway across the entrance hall They found the way 
upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. 10 




HALLOWEEN 

Malfoy seized 
the package from Harry and felt the package from Harry. 

“That’s a broomstick,” That’s a broomstick said, throwing the package from Harry back to Harry Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on Harry face. 
“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t 
allowed Harry Potter.” 

Ron couldn’t resist it. 

“It’s not any old broomstick,” It’s not any old broomstick said, “It’s a Nimbus 
Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, 
Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. 
“Comets look flashy, but Comets’re not in the same 
league as the Nimbus.” 

“What would you know about it, Weasley, you 
couldn’t afford half the handle,” 10 




HALLOWEEN 

Malfoy snapped back. 
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up 
twig by twig.” 

Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared 
at 10 




HALLOWEEN 

Malfoy’s elbow. 

“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” Ron squeaked. 

“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said 
10 




HALLOWEEN 

Malfoy quickly. 

“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, 
beaming at Harry. “Professor Flitwick told me all 
about the special circumstances, Harry Potter. And what 
model is it?” 

Page | 185 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting 
not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. 
“And it’s really thanks to 10 




HALLOWEEN 

Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” 
10 




HALLOWEEN 

Malfoy added. 

Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering Harry and Ron 
laughter at 10 




HALLOWEEN 

Malfoy obvious rage and confusion. 

“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the 
top of the marble staircase, “If Harry hadn’t stolen 
Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. ...” 

“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking 
rules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. 
Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking 
disapprovingly at the package from Harry in Harry’s hand. 

“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry. 

“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so 
much good.” 

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. 

Harry had a lot of trouble keeping Harry mind on Harry 
lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the 
dormitory where Harry new broomstick was lying under 
Harry bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where 
Harry’d be learning to play that night. Harry bolted Harry 
dinner that evening without noticing what Harry was 
eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap 
the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. 

“Wow,” Ron sighed, as his new broomstick rolled onto 
Harry’s bedspread. 

Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different 
brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and 
shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of 

Page | 186 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand 
written in gold near the top. 

As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and 
set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d 
never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of 
seats were raised in stands around the Quidditch field so that 
the spectators were high enough to see what was 
going on. At either end of the Quidditch field were three golden 
poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harrythe little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles 
through, except that They were fifty feet high. 

Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harrymounted his new broomstick and kicked off from the 
ground. What a feeling — Harry swooped in and out of 
the goal posts and then sped up and down the Quidditch field. 
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever Harry 
wanted at Harry lightest touch. 

“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” 

Oliver Wood had arrived. Oliver Wood was carrying a large 
wooden crate under Oliver Wood arm. Harry landed next to 
Oliver Wood. 

“Very nice,” said Wood, Oliver Wood eyes glinting. “I see what 
McGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I’m 
just going to teach you the rules this evening, then 
you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” 

McGonagall opened a large 
wooden crate. Inside were four different-sized 
balls. 

“Right,” said Oliver Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to 
understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are 
seven players on each side. Three of them are called 
Chasers.” 



Page | 187 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Oliver Wood took out a 
bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. 

“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Oliver Wood. “The 
Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and 
get the Quaffle through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten 
points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the 
hoops. Follow me?” 

“The 
Chasers throw the Quaffle and put the Quaffle through 
the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of 
like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t 
it?” 



“What’s basketball?” said Oliver Wood curiously. 

“Never mind,” said Harry quickly. 

“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called 
the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly 
around our hoops and stop the other team from 
scoring.” 

“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was 
determined to remember it all. “And they play with 
the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He 
pointed at the three balls left inside the box. 

“I’ll show you now,” said Oliver Wood. “Take this.” 

He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short 
baseball bat. 

“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Oliver Woodsaid. “These two are the Bludgers.” 

He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and 
slightly smaller than 
the Quaffle. Harry noticed 



Page | 188 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps 
holding they inside the box. 

“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. Harry bent down and 
freed one of the Bludgers. 

At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then 
pelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at Harry’s face with 
the bat to stop Harry’s face from breaking Harry nose, and sent Harry’s face 
zigzagging away into the air — Harry’s face zoomed around their 
heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of Harry’s face 
and managed to pin Harry’s face to the ground. 

“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger 
back into a large 
wooden crate and strapping a large 
wooden crate down safely. “The 
Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off 
their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on 
each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s the Weasley twinsjob to protect the Weasley twins side from the Bludgers and try and 
knock the Weasley twins toward the other team. So — think you’ve 
got all that?” 

“Three The 
Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the 
Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep The 
Bludgers away from the Beaters ,” Harry reeled off. 

“Very good,” said Oliver Wood. 

“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harryasked, hoping Harry sounded offhand. 

“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken 
jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last 
member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And 
you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or The 
Bludgers — ” 

“ — unless they crack my head open.” 



Page | 189 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for 
the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of the Bludgers.” 

Oliver Wood reached into a large 
wooden crate and took out the fourth 
and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and The 
Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. 
it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver 
wings. 

“This,” said Oliver Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and This’s the 
most important ball of the lot. This’s very hard to catch 
because This’s so fast and difficult to see. This’s the 
Seeker’s job to catch This. You’ve got to weave in and out 
of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get 
it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever 
Seeker catches the Golden Snitch wins the Golden Snitch team an extra 
hundred and fifty points, so the Golden Snitch nearly always win. 
That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Golden Snitch is caught, so the Golden Snitch 
can go on for ages — I think the record is three 
months, the Golden Snitch had to keep bringing on substitutes so 
the players could get some sleep. 

“Well, that’s it — any questions?” 

Harry shook Harry head. Harry understood what Harry had to 
do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the 
problem. 

“We won’t practice with the Golden Snitch yet,” said Wood, 
carefully shutting Wood back inside a large 
wooden crate, “Wood’s too 
dark, we might lose Wood. Let’s try you out with a few of 
these.” 

Harry pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of Harry pocket 
and a few minutes later, Harry and Harry were up in the 
air, Oliver Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as Harry could 
in every direction for Harry to catch. 

Page | 190 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Oliver Wood was 
delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen 
and he and Harry couldn’t carry on. 

“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” 
said Oliver Wood happily as Oliver Wood trudged back up to the 
castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better 
than Charlie Weasley, and Charlie Weasley could have played for 
England if Charlie Weasley hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” 

Perhaps it was because Charlie Weasley was now so busy, what 
with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top 
of all Charlie Weasley homework, but Harry could hardly believe it 
when Charlie Weasley realized that Charlie Weasley’d already been at Hogwarts 
two months. the castle felt more like home than 
Privet Drive ever had. Charlie Weasley lessons, too, were becoming 
more and more interesting now that they had 
mastered the basics. 

On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious 
smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the 
corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced 
in Charms that Professor Flitwick thought they were ready to start 
making objects fly, something they had all been dying 
to try since they’d seen Professor Flitwick make Neville’s toad zoom 
around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the 
class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was 
Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville 
had been trying to catch Neville 
 eye). Neville 
, however, was 
to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to 
tell whether Neville 
 or Hermione was angrier about this. 
Hermione hadn’t spoken to either of Ron or Hermione was angrier about this since the day 
Harry’s broomstick had arrived. 

“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve 
been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, 
perched on top of Professor Flitwick pile of books as usual. “Swish 
and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the 
magic words properly is very important, too — never 
Page | 191 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f and 
found himself on the floor with a buffalo on himself 
chest.” 

It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and 
flicked, but the feather Harry and Seamus were supposed to be 
sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got 
so impatient that himself prodded the desktop with himself wand and set 
fire to the desktop — Harry had to put the desktop out with Harry hat. 

Neville 
, at the next table, wasn’t having much more 
luck. 

“Wingardium Leviosal” Wingardium Leviosal shouted, waving Wingardium Leviosal long 
arms like a windmill. 

“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. 
“it’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and 
long.” 

“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Neville 
 snarled. 

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of Hermione gown, flicked 
his wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ 

“Wingardium LeviosaV rose off the desk and hovered about four 
feet above “Wingardium LeviosaV heads. 

“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. 
“Everyone see here, It’s done it!” 

Neville 
 was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. 

“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Neville 
 said to Harry Harry as Harry pushed Harry way into the crowded 
corridor, “Harry’s a nightmare, honestly.” 



Page | 192 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past 
Harry. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of Harry 
face — and was startled to see that Harry was in tears. 

“I think Harry heard you.” 

“So?” said Neville 
, but Neville 
 looked a bit uncomfortable. 
“Harry must’ve noticed Harry’s got no friends.” 

Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t 
seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great 
Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Neville 
 overheard 
Parvati Patil telling Harry friend Lavender that Hermione 
was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be 
left alone. Neville 
 looked still more awkward at this, but 
a moment later the girls had entered the Great Hall, 
where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of 
the girls minds. 

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and 
ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the 
tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the 
pumpkins stutter. the Halloween feast appeared suddenly on 
the golden plates, as the Halloween feast had at the start-of-term 
banquet. 

Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato 
when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great 
Hall, 
Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face. Everyone 
stared as Harry reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, 
slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in 
the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” 

Harry then sank to the floor in a dead faint. 

There was an uproar. an uproar took several purple 
firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor 
Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence. 



Page | 193 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Prefects,” 193 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Prefects rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the 
dormitories immediately!” 

Percy was in Percy element. 

“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear 
the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind 
me, now. Make way, first years coming through! 
Excuse me, I’m a prefect!” 

“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as a troll 
climbed the stairs. 

“Don’t ask me, a troll’re supposed to be really stupid,” 
said Neville 
. “Maybe Peeves let Peeves in for a Halloween 
joke.” 

They passed different groups of people hurrying in 
different directions. As They jostled They way through 
a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly 
grabbed Ron’s arm. 

“I’ve just thought Hermione.” 

“What about Hermione?” 

“Hermione doesn’t know about the troll.” 

Neville 
 bit Neville 
 lip. 

“Oh, all right,” Neville 
 snapped. “But Percy’d better not 
see us.” 

Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the 
other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and 
hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. they had just 
turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps 
behind they. 



Page | 194 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Percy!” hissed Neville 
, pulling Harry behind a large 
stone griffin. 

Peering around a large 
stone griffin, however, 194 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Percy!” saw not Percy but 
Snape. Percy crossed a deserted side corridor and disappeared from 
view. 

“What’s Percy doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t Percy 
down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” 

“Search me.” 

Quietly as possible, Quietly crept along the next corridor 
after Snape ’s fading footsteps. 

“Percy’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Neville 
held up Percy hand. 

“Can you smell something?” 

Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached Harry nostrils, a 
mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no 
one seems to clean. 

And then they heard no 
one — a low grunting, and the 
shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Neville 
 pointed — at 
the end of a passage to the left, something huge was 
moving toward they. they shrank into the shadows 
and watched as the shadows 
 emerged into a patch of moonlight. 

the shadows 
 was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, the shadows 
 skin was a 
dull, granite gray, the shadows 
 great lumpy body like a boulder 
with the shadows 
 small bald head perched on top like a 
coconut. the shadows 
 had short legs thick as tree trunks with 
flat, horny feet. The smell coming from the shadows 
 was 
incredible. The smell coming from it was holding a huge wooden club, which 
dragged along the third floor because The smell coming from it arms were so long. 



Page | 195 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. 
the troll waggled the troll long ears, making up the troll tiny mind, then 
slouched slowly into the room. 

“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could 
lock the troll in.” 

“Good idea,” said Neville 
 nervously. 

the troll edged toward the open door, mouths dry, 
praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of the troll. With 
one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam 
the door, and lock the key. 

“Yes!” 

Flushed with the troll victory, the troll started to run back 
up the passage, but as the troll reached the corner the troll 
heard something that made the troll hearts stop — a 
high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the 
chamber they’d just chained up. 

“Oh, no,” said Neville 
, pale as the Bloody Baron. 

“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped. 

“ Hermionel” Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron said together. 

It was the last thing Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron wanted to do, but what 
choice did Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron have? Wheeling around, Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron sprinted 
back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron 
panic. Harry pulled the door open and Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron ran 
inside. 

Granger was shrinking against the wall 
opposite, looking as if Granger was about to faint. the trollwas advancing on Granger, knocking the sinks off the 
walls as the troll went. 



Page | 196 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Neville 
, and, 
seizing a tap, Harry threw it as hard as Harry could against 
the wall. 

the troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. the troll 
lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had 
made the noise. the troll mean little eyes saw Harry. the troll 
hesitated, then made for Harry instead, lifting the troll club 
as the troll went. 

“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Neville 
 from the other side of the 
chamber, and Neville 
 threw a metal pipe at a metal pipe. the trolldidn’t even seem to notice a metal pipe hitting a metal pipe 
shoulder, but a metal pipe heard the yell and paused again, 
turning a metal pipe ugly snout toward Neville 
 instead, giving 
Harry time to run around a metal pipe. 

“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying 
to pull Hermione toward the door, but Hermione couldn’t move, 
Hermione was still flat against the wall, Hermione mouth open 
with terror. 

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the 
troll berserk. the 
troll berserk roared again and started toward Neville 
, 
who was nearest and had no way to escape. 

Harry then did something that was both very brave 
and very stupid: Harry took a great running jump and 
managed to fasten Harry arms around the troll’s neck 
from behind. the troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging 
there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit 
of wood up even a troll nose, and Harry’s wand had still been 
in Harry hand when Harry’d jumped — it had gone straight 
up one of the troll’s nostrils. 

Howling with pain, even a troll twisted and flailed it 
club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, 
even a troll was going to rip Harry off or catch Harry a 
terrible blow with its 
club. 

Page | 197 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione had sunk to the third floor in fright; Neville 
 pulled 
out Neville 
 own wand — not knowing what Neville 
 was going 
to do Neville 
 heard Neville 
 cry the first spell that came 
into Neville 
 head: “Wingardium Leviosal” 

its 
club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose 
high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and 
dropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s 
head. even a troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat 
on even a troll face, with a thud that made the whole room 
tremble. 

Harry got to Harry feet. Harry was shaking and out of 
breath. Neville 
 was standing there with his own wand still 
raised, staring at what Neville 
 had done. 

It was Hermione who spoke first. 

“Is it — dead?” 

“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been 
knocked out.” 

Neville 
 bent down and pulled his own wand out of the troll’s 
nose. his own wand was covered in what looked like lumpy gray 
glue. 

“Urgh — troll boogers.” 

Neville 
 wiped it on the troll’s trousers. 

A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the 
three of them look up. them hadn’t realized what a 
racket them had been making, but of course, someone 
downstairs must have heard the crashes and the 
troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall 
had come bursting into the whole room 
, closely followed by 
Snape, with Professor Quirrell bringing up the rear. Professor QuirrellPage | 198 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




took one look at even a troll, let out a faint whimper, and 
sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. 


Snape bent over even a troll. Professor McGonagall 
 was 
looking at Neville 
 and Harry. Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall 
 
look so angry. Professor McGonagall 
 lips were white. Hopes of winning 
fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s 
mind. 

“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor 
McGonagall, with cold fury in Professor 
 voice. Harry looked 
at Ron, who was still standing with his own wand in the 
air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you 
in your dormitory?
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked 
at the third floor. Harry wished Neville 
 would put his own wand down. 

Then a small voice came out of the shadows. 

“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for 
me.” 

“Miss Granger!” 

Hermione had managed to get to his feet at last. 

“I went looking for even a troll because I — I thought I 
could deal with even a troll on my own — you know, because 
I’ve read all about even a troll.” 

Neville 
 dropped his own wand. Granger, telling a 
downright lie to a teacher? 

“If even a troll hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harrystuck his own wand up Harry nose and Neville 
 knocked his own wand out 
with his own wand own club. They didn’t have time to come and 
fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when They 
arrived.” 

Page | 199 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry and Neville 
 tried to look as though this story 
wasn’t new to Harry and Ron. 

“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, 
staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you 
foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a 
mountain troll on your own?” 

Hermione hung Hermione head. Harry was speechless. 
Hermione was the last person to do anything against 
the rules, and here Hermione was, pretending Hermione had, to 
get them out of trouble. It was as if 
Snape had started 
handing out sweets. 

“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from 
Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall 
. “I’m 
very disappointed in Professor McGonagall 
. If you’re not hurt at all, 
you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are 
finishing the feast in Students Houses.” 

Hermione left. 

Professor McGonagall 
 turned to Harry and Ron. 

“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first 
years could have taken on a full-grown mountain 
troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor 
Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.” 

They hurried out of the 
chamber and didn’t speak at 
all until They had climbed two floors up. It was a relief 
to be away from the smell of even a troll, quite apart from 
anything else. 

“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Neville 
grumbled. 

“Five, you mean, once Neville 
’s taken off Hermione ’s.” 



Page | 200 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Good of Neville 
 to get We out of trouble like that,” Neville 
admitted. “Mind you, We did save Neville 
.” 

“Neville 
 might not have needed saving if We hadn’t 
locked the thing in with Neville 
,” Harry reminded Harry. 

we hadn’t 
 had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. 

“Pig snout,” we hadn’t 
 said and entered. 

The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone 
was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, 
however, stood alone by the door, waiting for Everyone 
. 
There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of 
Everyone 
 looking at each other, none of 
them said “Thanks,” 
and hurried off to get plates. 

But from that moment on, Granger became 
their friend. There are some things you can’t share 
without ending up liking each other, and knocking 
out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of a twelve-foot mountain troll.

QUIDDITCH 

As QUIDDITCH 

 entered November, the weather turned very 
cold. The mountains around the school became icy 
gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the 
ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen 
from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on 
the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin 
overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin 
boots. 

The QUIDDITCH 

 season had begun. On Saturday, Harrywould be playing in Harry first match after weeks of 
training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor 
won, Gryffindor 
 would move up into second place in the 
House Championship. 

Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood 
had decided that, as anyone secret weapon, Harryshould be kept, well, secret. But the news that Harry was 
playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harrydidn’t know which was worse — people telling Harry 
Harry’d be brilliant or people telling Harry — people’d be 
running around underneath Harry holding a mattress. 
Page | 202 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a 
friend. Harry didn’t know how he’d have gotten through 
all Harry homework without Harry now had Hermione as a 
friend, what with all the last- 
minute Quidditch practice Wood was making Quidditch practice Wood 
do. Harry now had Hermione as a 
friend had also lent Harry Quidditch Through the Ages, 
which turned out to be a very interesting read. 

Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of 
committing a Quidditch foul and that all of seven hundred ways of 
committing a Quidditch foul had 
happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that 
Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, 
and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to 
happen to seven hundred ways of 
committing a Quidditch foul; that although people rarely died 
playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish 
and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. 

Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about 
breaking rules since Harry and Neville 
 had saved Hermione 
from the mountain troll, and Hermione was much nicer for 
it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the 
three of them were out in the freezing courtyard 
during break, and Hermione had conjured them up a bright 
blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. 
them were standing with them backs to it, getting 
warm, when 
Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at 
once that 
Snape was limping. Harry, Neville 
, and 
Hermione moved closer together to block a bright 
blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from 
view; Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. 
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione guilty faces 
caught Snape’s eye. 
Snape limped over. 
Snape hadn’t seen 
a bright 
blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but 
Snape seemed to be looking for a reason to 
tell Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione off anyway. 

“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” 

Potter was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed Harry. 



Page | 203 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling “Library books are not to be taken outside the 
school,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from 
Gryffindor.” 

“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily 
as Snape limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with 
He leg?” 

“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting He,” said Hebitterly. 

The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that 
evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next 
to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s 
Charms homework for Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Hermione would never let 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking Hermione 
to read it through, Harry, Ron, and Hermione got the right answers anyway. 

Harry felt restless. Harry wanted Quidditch Through the 
Ages back, to take Harry mind off Harry nerves about 
tomorrow. Why should Harry be afraid of Snape? Getting 
up, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask 
Snape if Harry could have it. 

“Better you than Harry,” Ron, and Hermione said together, but Harryhad an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were 
other teachers listening. 

Harry made Harry way down to the staffroom and knocked. 
There was no answer. Harry knocked again. Nothing. 

Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was 
worth a try. Harry pushed the door ajar and peered 
inside — and a horrible scene met Harry eyes. 

Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was 
holding Snape robes above Snape knees. One of Snape legs was 
bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape 
bandages. 

Page | 204 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you 
supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at 
once?” 

Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — 

“POTTER!Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as Snape dropped his robes above his knees quickly to hide Snape leg. Harry gulped. 

“I just wondered if I could have the book back.” 

“GET OUT! OUT!” 

Harry left, before Snape could take any more points 
from Gryffindor. Harry sprinted back upstairs. 

“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. 
“What’s the matter?” 

In a low whisper, Harry told them what Harry’d seen. 

“You know what this means?” Harry finished 
breathlessly. “Harry tried to get past that three-headed 
dog at Halloween! That’s where Harry was going when we 
saw Harry — Harry’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d 
bet my broomstick Harry let that troll in, to make a 
diversion!” 

Hermione’s eyes were wide. 

“No — Harry wouldn’t,” she said. “I know Harry’s not very 
nice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something 
Dumbledore was keeping safe.” 

“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints 
or something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I 



Page | 205 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s Snape 
after? What’s that dog guarding?” 

Harry went to bed with Harry head buzzing with the 
same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harrycouldn’t sleep. Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry 
needed to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch 
match in a few hours — but the expression on 
Snape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy 
to forget. 

The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The 
Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried 
sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking 
forward to a good Quidditch match. 

“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.” 

“I don’t want anything.” 

“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione. 

“I’m not hungry.” 

Harry felt terrible. In an hour’s time Harry’d be walking 
onto the field. 

“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus 
Finnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get 
clobbered by the other team.” 

“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile 
ketchup on Seamus sausages. 

By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out 
in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many 
students had binoculars. The seats might be raised 
high in the air, but The seats was still difficult to see what 
was going on sometimes. 

Page | 206 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean 
the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for HarryHarry, they had painted a large banner on one of the 
sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for 
President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had 
done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then 
Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that 
the paint flashed different colors. 

Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of 
the team were changing into the team scarlet Quidditch 
robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) . 

Wood cleared Wood throat for silence. 

“Okay, men,” Wood said. 

“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson. 

“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.” 

“The big one,” said Fred Weasley. 

“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George. 

“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, 
“We were on the team last year.” 

“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team 
Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know 
it.” 

Oliver glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.” 

“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.” 

Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker 
room and, hoping Harry knees weren’t going to give way, 
walked onto the field to loud cheers. 

Page | 207 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Madam Hooch was refereeing. Madam Hooch stood in the 
middle of the field waiting for the two teams, Madam Hooch 
broom in Madam Hooch hand. 

“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” Madam Hooch said, 
once they were all gathered around Madam Hooch. Harry noticed 
that Madam Hooch seemed to be speaking particularly to the 
Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harrythought Flint looked as if Harry had some troll blood in 
Harry. Out of the corner of Harry eye Harry saw the fluttering 
banner high above, flashing Potter for President over 
the crowd. Harry heart skipped. Harry felt braver. 

“Mount your brooms, please.” 

Harry clambered onto Harry Nimbus Two Thousand. 

Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on Madam Hooch silver whistle. 

Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. Fifteen brooms 
were off. 

“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina 
Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser 
that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” 

“JORDAN!” 

“Sorry, Professor.” 

The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the 
commentary for the match, closely watched by 
Professor McGonagall. 

“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass 
to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last 
year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the 
Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain 
Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint 
Page | 208 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, 
stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper 
Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s 
Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive 
around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that 
must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a 
Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s 
Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but 
’s 
Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by 
Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play 
by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back 
in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and 
off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding 
Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, 
Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — 
GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” 

Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and 
moans from the Slytherins. 

“Budge up there, move along.” 

“Hagrid!” 

Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid 
enough space to join Ron and Hermione. 

“Bin watchin’ from “Bin hut,” said Hagrid 
, patting a 
large pair of binoculars around Hagrid 
 neck, “But it isn’t 
the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch 
yet, eh?” 

“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” 

“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said 
Hagrid 
, raising Hagrid 
 binoculars and peering skyward at 
the speck that was Harry. 



Page | 209 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Way up above 209 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




, Harry was gliding over the game, 
squinting about for some sign of the Snitch 
. This was 
part of Harry and Wood’s game plan. 

“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch 
,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked 
before you have to be.” 

When Angelina 
 had scored, Harry had done a couple 
of loop-the-loops to let off Harry feelings. Now Harry was 
back to staring around for the Snitch 
. Once Harry caught 
sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection 
from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a 
Bludger decided to come pelting Harry way, more like a 
cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and 
Fred Weasley came chasing after it. 

“All right there, Harry?” Harry had time to yell, as Harry 
beat a 
Bludger furiously toward Flint. 

“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, 
“Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, 
and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a 
moment — was that the Snitch 
?” 

A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey 
dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over Adrian Pucey 
 
shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed Adrian Pucey 
 left 
ear. 

Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement Harry dived 
downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker 
Terence Higgs had seen Slytherin Seeker 
Terence Higgs, too. Neck and neck they 
hurtled toward the Snitch 
 — all the Chasers seemed 
to have forgotten what all the Chasers were supposed to be 
doing as all the Chasers hung in midair to watch. 



Page | 210 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was faster than Terence Higgs — Harry could see the little 
round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — Harry 
put on an extra spurt of speed — 

WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors 
below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, 
and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on 
for dear life. 

“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors 
. 

Madam Hooch spoke angrily to — Marcus Flint and then ordered 
a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all 
the confusion, of course, the Snitch 
 had 
disappeared from sight again. 

Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send 
Dean Thomas off, ref! Red card!” 

“What are you talking about, Dean Thomas?” said Ron. 

“Red card!” said Dean Thomas furiously. “In soccer you get 
shown the red card and you’re out of the game!” 

“But this isn’t soccer, Dean Thomas,” Ron reminded Ron. 

Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side. 

“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked 
Harry outta the air.” 

Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. 

“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of 
cheating — ” 

“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall. 

“I mean, after that open and revolting foul — ” 

Page | 211 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Jordan, I’m warning you — ” 



“All right, all right. — Marcus Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor 
Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a 
penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it 
away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor 
still in possession.” 

It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went 
spinning dangerously past Harry head, that it happened. 
Harry broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a 
split second, Harry thought Harry was going to fall. Harry 
gripped His broom tightly with both Harry hands and 
knees. He’d never felt anything like that. 

It happened again. It was as though His broom was 
trying to buck Harry off. But Nimbus Two Thousands 
did not suddenly decide to buck Nimbus Two Thousands 
 riders off. Harrytried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — 
Harry had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — 
and then Harry realized that His broom was completely 
out of Harry control. Harry couldn’t turn his broom was completely 
out of his control. Harry couldn’t 
direct his broom was completely 
out of his control at all. his broom was completely 
out of his control was zigzagging through the air, and 
every now and then making violent swishing 
movements that almost unseated Harry. 

Lee Jordan was still commentating. 

“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — 
passes Spinnet — passes Higgs — hit hard in the face 
by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, 
Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” 

the Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have 
noticed that His broom was behaving strangely His broom 
was carrying Harry slowly higher, away from the game, 
jerking and twitching as His broom went. 



Page | 212 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Dunno what Harry thinks Harry’s doing,” Hagrid 
mumbled. Harry stared through his binoculars. “If I 
didn’ know better, I’d say Harry’d lost control of Harry 
broom ... but Harry can’t have. ...” 

Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over 
the stands. his 
broom had started to roll over and 
over, with Harry only just managing to hold on. Then 
the whole crowd gasped. his 
broom had given a 
wild jerk and Harry swung off a 
wild jerk. Harry was now dangling 
from a 
wild jerk, holding on with only one hand. 

“Did something happen to it when — Marcus Flint blocked Harry?” 
Seamus whispered. 

“Can’t have,Hagrid 
 said, Hagrid 
 voice shaking. “Can’t 
nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful 
Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two 
Thousand.” 

At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, 
but instead of looking up at Harry, Hermione started 
looking frantically at the whole crowd. 

“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced. 

“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” 

Ron grabbed his binoculars. Snape was in the middle 
of the stands opposite them. Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath. 

“Snape’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said 
Hermione. 

“What should we do?” 

“Leave it to “.” 



Page | 213 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had 
disappeared. Ron turned his binoculars back on HarryHarry. his 
broom was vibrating so hard, his 
broom was almost 
impossible for Ron to hang on much longer. the whole crowd was on the whole crowd feet, watching, terrified, as the 
Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one 
of the whole crowd brooms, but it was no good — every time the whole crowd 
got near Ron, his 
broom would jump higher still. the whole crowd 
dropped lower and circled beneath Ron, obviously 
hoping to catch Ron if Ron fell. — Marcus Flint seized the 
Quaffle and scored five times without anyone 
noticing. 

“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately. 

Hermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand 
where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row 
behind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape 
knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in 
front. Reaching Snape, Snape crouched down, pulled 
out Snape wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen 
words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto 
the hem of Snape ’s robes. 

It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize 
that Snape was on fire. A sudden yelp told Snape Snape had 
done Snape job. Scooping fire off Snape into a little jar 
in Snape pocket, Snape scrambled back along the row — 
Snape would never know what had happened. 

It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able 
to clamber back on to his 
broom. 

“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been 
sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes. 

Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw Harry clap Harry hand to Harry mouth as though

 . 

“I’ve got the Snitch 
!” Page | 214 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 shouted, waving it above Page | 214 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 
head, and the game ended in complete confusion. 

“Page | 214 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 didn’t catch it, Page | 214 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 nearly swallowed it,” — Marcus Flint was 
still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no 
difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — 
Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy 
points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. Harry 
was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s 
hut, with Ron and Hermione. 

“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I 
saw Ron. Ron was cursing your broomstick, muttering, 
Ron wouldn’t take his eyes off Ron.” 

“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of 
what had gone on next to Ron in the stands. “Why 
would Snape do somethin’ like that?” 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, 
wondering what to tell Ron. Harry decided on the 
truth. 

“I found out something about Harry,” Harry told Hagrid. 
“Harry tried to get past that three-headed dog on 
Halloween. It bit Harry. We think Harry was trying to steal 
whatever it’s guarding.” 

Hagrid dropped the teapot. 

“How do you know about Fluffy?” Harry said. 

“ Fluffy ?” 



Page | 215 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah — Page | 215 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling

 off a Greek chappie

 to Dumbledore 
to guard the — ” 

“Yes?” said Harry eagerly. 

“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. 
“That’s top secret, that is.” 

“But Snape’s trying to steal That.” 

“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts 
teacher, Snape’d do nothin’ of the sort.” 

“So why did Snape just try and kill Harry?” cried 
Hermione. 

The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have 
changed her mind about Snape. 

“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all 
about all 
! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and 
Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw Snape!” 

“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ 
know why His broom acted like that, but Snapewouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to yeh, all 
three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ 
concern yeh. His broom’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ 
you forget what His broom’s guardin’, that’s between Professor 
Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” 

“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas 
Flamel involved, is there?” 

Hagrid looked furious with Hagrid.

THE MIRROR OF ERISED 

Christmas was coming. One morning in mid- 
December, Hogwarts 
 woke to find Hogwarts 
 covered in 
several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the 
Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several 
snowballs so that the 
Weasley twins followed Quirrell around, 
bouncing off the back of Quirrell turban. The few owls that 
managed to battle their way through the stormy sky 
to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before The few owls that 
managed to battle their way through the stormy sky 
to deliver mail could fly off again. 

No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the 
Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had 
roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and 
a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. 
Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in 
the dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist 
before Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to 
Worst of all hot cauldrons. 

“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions 
class, “for all those people who have to stay at 



Page | 217 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted 
at home.” 

He was looking over at Harry as He spoke. Crabbe and 
Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out 
powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored Harry, who was measuring out 
powdered spine of lion-fish. Malfoy had 
been even more unpleasant than usual since the 
Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had 
lost, He had tried to get everyone laughing at how a 
wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as 
Seeker next. Then He’d realized that nobody found 
this funny, because they were all so impressed at the 
way Harry had managed to stay on Harry bucking 
broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone 
back to taunting Harry about having no proper 
family. 

It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet 
Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come 
around the week before, making a list of students 
who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had 
signed up at once. Harry didn’t feel sorry for Harry at 
all; this would probably be the best Christmas Harry’d 
ever had. Ron and Ron brothers were staying, too, 
because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania 
to visit Charlie. 

When Ron and his brothers left the dungeons at the end of Potions, 
Ron and his brothers found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. 
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a 
loud puffing sound told Two enormous feet that Hagrid was behind 
Hagrid. 

“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking Ron 
head through the branches. 

“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”

“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came 
Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying 
to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be 
gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts 
, I 
suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a 
palace compared to what your family’s used to.” 

Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. 

“WEASLEY!” 

Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes. 

“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, 
sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree. 
Malfoy was insultin’ Malfoy family.” 

“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, 
Hagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from 
Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more. 
Move along, all of you.” 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the 
tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. 

“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s 
back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” 

“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” 

“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said 
Hagrid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the 
Great Hall, looks a treat.” 

So the three of them followed Hagrid and Hagrid tree off 
to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and 
Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas 
decorations. 



Page | 219 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, 
would you?” 

the 
Great Hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and 
mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than 
twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the 
room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering 
with hundreds of candles. 

“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” 
Hagrid asked. 

“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — 
Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we 
should be in the library.” 

“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes 
away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden 
bubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing 
them over the branches of the new tree. 

“the library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the 
Great Hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” 

“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told Harry brightly. 

“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been 
trying to find out who Harry is.” 

“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — 
I’ve told yeh — drop it. it’s nothin’ to you what that 
dog’s guardin’.” 

“we just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s 
all,” said Hermione. 

“Unless you’d like to tell we and save we the trouble?” 
Harry added. “we must’ve been through hundreds of 
books already and we can’t find Nicolas Flamel anywhere — just 



Page | 220 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




give we a hint — I know I’ve read Nicolas Flamel name 
somewhere.” 

“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly. 

“Just have to find out for we, then,” said Ron, 
and Ron, 
 left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried 
off to the library. 

Ron, 
 had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s 
name ever since Hagrid had let Hagrid slip, because how 
else were Ron, 
 going to find out what Snape was 
trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to 
know where to begin, not knowing what Nicolas Flamel might 
have done to get Nicolas Flamel into a book. Nicolas Flamel wasn’t in 
Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable 
Magical Names of Our Time ; Nicolas Flamel was missing, too, from 
Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of 
Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of 
course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of 
thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds 
of narrow rows. 

Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles Hermione had 
decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of 
books and started pulling them off the shelves at 
random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted 
Section. Harry had been wondering for a while if Nicolas Flamelwasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you 
needed a specially signed note from one of the 
teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and Harry 
knew Harry’d never get one. These were 
bookscontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at 
Hogwarts 
, and only read by older students studying 
advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. 

“What are you looking for, boy?” 

“Nothing,” said Harry. 

Page | 221 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather 
duster at the librarian. 

“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!” 

Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some 
story, Harry left the library. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
had already agreed He, Ron, and Hermione 
’d better not ask Madam 
Pince where He, Ron, and Hermione 
 could find Nicolas Flamel. He, Ron, and Hermione 
 were sure 
Madam 
’d be able to tell He, Ron, and Hermione 
, but He, Ron, and Hermione 
 couldn’t risk 
Snape hearing what He, Ron, and Hermione 
 were up to. 

Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other 
two had found anything, but Harry wasn’t very hopeful. 
He, Ron, and Hermione 
 had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as 
He, Ron, and Hermione 
 only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t 
surprising He, Ron, and Hermione 
’d found nothing. What He, Ron, and Hermione 
 really 
needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince 
breathing down He, Ron, and Hermione 
 necks. 

Five minutes later, Ron and his brothers joined Ron, 
shaking Ron and his brothers heads. Ron and his brothers went off to lunch. 

“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” 
said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find 
anything.” 

“And you could ask your parents if your parents know who 
Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask your parents.” 

“Very safe, as your parents’re both dentists,” said Hermione. 

Once the holidays had started, Ron and his brothers were 
having too good a time to think much about Flamel. 
Ron and his brothers had the dormitory to Ron and his brothers and the 
common room was far emptier than usual, so Ron and his brothers 
were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. Ron and his brothers 
sat by the hour eating anything Ron and his brothers could spear on a 
toasting fork — bread, English muffins, 

Page | 222 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy 
expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they 
wouldn’t work. 

Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This 
was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures 
were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in 
battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like 
everything else Ron’s owned, Ron’s set had once belonged to 
someone else in Ron’s family — in this case, Ron’s 
grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a 
drawback at all. Ron knew old chessmen so well Ron never had 
trouble getting old chessmen to do what Ron wanted. 

Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had 
lent Harry, and old chessmen didn’t trust Harry at all. Harry wasn’t a 
very good player yet and old chessmen kept shouting different 
bits of advice at Harry, which was confusing. “Don’t 
send me there, can’t you see Harry knight? Send Harry, we 
can afford to lose Harry.” 

On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward 
to the next day for the food and the fun, but not 
expecting any presents at all. When Harry woke early in 
the morning, however, the first thing Harry saw was a 
small pile of packages at the foot of Harry bed. 

“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry 
scrambled out of bed and pulled on Harry 
 bathrobe. 

“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got 
some presents!” 

“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to 
Ron own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s. 

Harry picked up the top parcel. the top parcel was wrapped in 
thick brown paper and scrawled across the top parcel was To 
Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden 

Page | 223 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it Hagrid. Harry 
blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. 

A second, very small parcel contained a note. 

We received your message and enclose your Christmas 
present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped 
to a note was a fifty-pence piece. 

“ThatRon’s friendly,” said Harry. 

Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. 

“ Weird\ ” Ron said, “What a shape! This is money?” 

“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how 
pleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — 
so who sent these?” 

“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, 
turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy 
parcel. “My mom. I told My mom you didn’t expect any 
presents and — oh, no,” Ron groaned, “My mom’s made you 
a Weasley sweater.” 

Harry had torn open a very lumpy 
parcel to find a thick, hand- 
knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of 
homemade fudge. 

“Every year My mom makes you 
a Weasley sweater,” said Ron, 
unwrapping Ron own, “and mine’s always maroon.” 

“That’s really nice of My mom,” said Harry, trying the 
fudge, which was very tasty. 

Harry next present also contained candy — a large box 
of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. 



Page | 224 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




This only left one parcel. Harry picked This up and felt 
This. This was very light. Harry unwrapped This. 

Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the 
floor where This lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. 

“I’ve heard of those,” Ron said in a hushed voice, 
dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten 
from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re 
really rare, and really valuable.” 

“What is it?” 

Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the 
floor where it lay in gleaming folds. It 
was strange to the touch, like water woven into 
material. 

“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on 
his face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.” 

Harry threw an Invisibility Cloak around Harry shoulders and Rongave a yell. 

“It is! Look down!” 

Harry looked down at Harry feet, but they were gone. Harry 
dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, Harry reflection 
looked back at Harry, just Harry head suspended in 
midair, Harry body completely invisible. Harry pulled an Invisibility Cloak his head and Harry reflection vanished 
completely. 

“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of 
it!” 



Harry pulled off an Invisibility Cloak and seized the letter. 
Written in narrow, loopy writing Harry had never seen 
before were the following words: 



Page | 225 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Your father left this in my possession before Your father died. It 
is time it was returned to you. 

Use it well. 

A Very Merry Christmas to you. 

There was no signature. Harry stared at a note. Ronwas admiring an Invisibility Cloak. 

“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” Ron said. “Anuthinq. 
What’s the matter?” 

“Nothing,” said Harry. Harry felt very strange. Who had 
sent an Invisibility Cloak? Had it really once belonged to Your father? 

Before Harry could say or think anything else, the 
dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George 
Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed an Invisibility Cloak quickly 
out of sight. Harry didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone 
else yet. 

“Merry Christmas!” 

“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” 

Fred and George 
 were wearing blue sweaters, one 
with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. 

“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred and Georgeholding up Harry’s sweater. “Harry obviously makes 
more of an effort if you’re not family.” 

“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George 
demanded. “Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and 
warm.” 



Page | 226 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as Ron 
pulled it over Ron head. 

“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George 
 observed. 

“I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But 
we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and 
Forge.” 

“What’s all this noise?” 

Weasley stuck his head through the door, 
looking disapproving. Weasley had clearly gotten halfway 
through unwrapping Weasley presents as Weasley, too, carried a 
lumpy sweater over Weasley arm, which Fred seized. 

“P for prefect! Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all 
wearing we, Harry Harry got one.” 

“I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins 
forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses 
askew. 

“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, 
either,” said George 
. “Merry Christmas is a time for family.” 

They frog-marched Percy from the room, They frog-marched Percy from the room arms 
pinned to They frog-marched Percy from the room side by They frog-marched Percy from the room . 

Harry had never in all Harry life had such a Christmas 
dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of 
roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; 
tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich 
gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard 
crackers every few feet along the table. These 
fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble 
Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with These 
fantastic party favors 
little plastic toys and These 
fantastic party favors flimsy paper hats inside. 
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and a wizard cracker didn’t 
just bang, a wizard cracker went off with a blast like a cannon and 
Page | 227 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




engulfed 227 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 in a cloud of blue smoke, while from 
the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several 
live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore 
had swapped Dumbledore 
 pointed wizardRon’s hat for a flowered 
bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor 
Flitwick had just read Professor 
Flitwick. 

Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. 
Percy nearly broke Percy teeth on a silver Sickle 
embedded in Percy slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting 
redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more 
wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the 
cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and 
blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided. 

When Harry finally left the table, Harry was laden down 
with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a 
pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- 
Your-Own-Warts kit, and Harry own new wizard chess 
set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a 
nasty feeling The white mice were going to end up as Mrs. 
Norris’s Christmas dinner. 

Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon 
having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, 
cold, wet, and gasping for breath, Harry and the Weasleys returned to the 
fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry 
broke in Harry 
 new chess set by losing spectacularly to RonRon. Harry 
 suspected Harry 
 wouldn’t have lost so badly if 
Percy hadn’t tried to help Harry 
 so much. 

After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, 
and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy 
to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy 
chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower 
because Percy 
chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower 
’d stolen his prefect badge. 

It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet 
something had been nagging at the back of Harry 
 mind 

Page | 228 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




all day. Not until Harry 
 climbed into bed was Harry 
 free to 
think about Not until he climbed into bed: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had 
sent Not until he climbed into bed. 

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing 
mysterious to bother Harry 
, fell asleep almost as soon 
as he’d drawn the curtains of Harry 
 four-poster. Harryleaned over the side of Harry own bed and pulled the 
cloak out from under it. 

Harry father’s ... this had been His father’s. Harry let the 
material flow over Harry hands, smoother than silk, light 
as air. Use it well, the note had said. 

Harry had to try it, now. Harry slipped out of bed and 
wrapped an Invisibility Cloak around Harry. Looking down at 
Harry legs, Harry saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a 
very funny feeling. 

Use It well. 

Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of 
Hogwarts was open to Harry in an Invisibility Cloak. Excitement 
flooded through Harry as Harry stood there in the dark 
and silence. Harry could go anywhere in this, anywhere, 
and Filch would never know. 

Ron grunted in Ron sleep. Should Harry wake Ron? 
Something held Ron back — His father’s cloak — Ron 
felt that this time — the first time — Ron wanted to use 
it alone. 

Ron crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across 
the common room, and climbed through the portrait 
hole. 

“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said 
nothing. Ron walked quickly down the corridor. 



Page | 229 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Where should Ron go? Ron stopped, Ron heart racing, 
and thought. And then it came to Ron. The Restricted 
Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long as 
Ron liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel 
was. Ron set off, drawing an Invisibility Cloak tight 
around Ron as Ron walked. 

the library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a 
lamp to see Harry way along the rows of books. a 
lamp looked as if a 
lamp was floating along in midair, and 
even though Harry could feel Harry arm supporting a 
lamp, 
the sight gave Harry the creeps. 

The Restricted 
Section in the library was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that 
separated these books from the rest of the library, Harry 
held up a 
lamp to read the titles. 

They didn’t tell Harry much. They peeling, faded gold 
letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t 
understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a 
dark stain on One book that looked horribly like blood. The 
hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe Harry 
was imagining it, maybe not, but Harry thought a faint 
whispering was coming from the books, as though 
they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be. 

Harry had to start somewhere. Setting a 
lamp down 
carefully on the floor, Harry looked along the bottom 
shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black 
and silver volume caught Harry eye. Harry pulled his eye out 
with difficulty, because his eye was very heavy, and, 
balancing his eye on Harry knee, let his eye fall open. 

A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — 
One book was screaming! Harry snapped One book shut, but 
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, 
earsplitting note. Harry stumbled backward and knocked 
over a 
lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, Harry 
Page | 230 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — 
stuffing One book back on the bottom 
shelf, Harry ran 
for One book. Harry passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, 
wild eyes looked straight through Harry, and Harryslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked 
off up the corridor, One bookFilch’s shrieks still ringing in 
Harry ears. 

Harry came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of 
armor. Harry had been so busy getting away from the library, Harry hadn’t paid attention to where Harry was 
going. Perhaps because it was dark, Harry didn’t 
recognize where Harry was at all. There was a suit of 
armor near the kitchens, Harry knew, but Harry must be 
five floors above there. 

“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if 
anyone was wandering around at night, and 
somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” 

Harry felt the blood drain out of Harry face. Wherever Harry 
was, Filch must know a shortcut, because Harry soft, 
greasy voice was getting nearer, and to Harry horror, it 
was Snape who replied, “The Restricted 
Section in the library? Well, 
they can’t be far, we’ll catch they.” 

Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape 
came around the corner ahead. Filch and Snape 
 couldn’t see 
Harry, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if 

 came much nearer they’d knock right into Harry — 
an Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Harry from being solid. 

Harry backed away as quietly as Harry could. A door stood 
ajar to Harry left. A door was Harry only hope. Harry squeezed 
through A door, holding Harry breath, trying not to move A door, 
and to Harry relief Harry managed to get inside the room 
without his relief noticing anything. his relief walked straight 
past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing 
deeply, listening to his relief footsteps dying away. That 
Page | 231 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




had been close, very close. It was a few seconds 
before Harry noticed anything about the room Harry had 
hidden in. 



It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes 
of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and 
there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but 
propped against the wall facing Harry was something 
that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that 
looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it 
out of the way. 

It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, 
with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed 
feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: 
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. 

Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. 

 panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch 
and Snape, Harry moved nearer to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, 
wanting to look at Harry but see no reflection again. 
Harry stepped in front of it. 

Harry had to clap his hands to Harry mouth to stop Harry 
from screaming. Harry whirled around. Harry heart was 
pounding far more furiously than when One book had 
screamed — for Harry had seen not only Harry in the 
mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right 
behind Harry. 

But the room he had 
 was empty. Breathing very fast, Harry 
turned slowly back to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling. 

There Harry was, reflected in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, white and scared- 
looking, and there, reflected behind Harry, were at least 
ten others. Harry looked over Harry shoulder — but still, 
no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was 
Harry in fact in a room full of invisible people and this 
mirrors trick was that it reflected invisible people, invisible or 
not? 

Page | 232 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry looked in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling again. A woman standing 
right behind Harry reflection was smiling at Harry and 
waving. Harry reached out a hand and felt the air behind 
Harry. If A woman standing 
right behind his reflection was really there, Harry’d touch A woman standing 
right behind his reflection, their 
reflections were so close together, but Harry felt only air 
— A woman standing 
right behind his reflection and the others existed only in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling. 

A woman standing 
right behind his reflection was a very pretty woman. A woman standing 
right behind his reflection had dark red hair 
and A woman standing 
right behind his reflection eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harrythought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright 
green — exactly the same shape, but then Harry noticed 
that A woman standing 
right behind his reflection was crying; smiling, but crying at the same 
time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next 
to A woman standing 
right behind his reflection put The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next 
to her arm around A woman standing 
right behind his reflection. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next 
to her wore glasses, and 
The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next 
to her hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just 
as Harry’s did. 

Harry was so close to the mirror now that Harry nose 
was nearly touching that of Harry reflection. 

“Mom?” Harry whispered. “Dad?” 

They just looked at Harry, smiling. And slowly, Harrylooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, 
and saw other pairs of green eyes like Harry, other noses 
like Harry, even a little old man who looked as though 
Harry had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry Harry was looking at 
Harry family, for the first time in Harry life. 

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and Harry stared 
hungrily back at The Potters, his hands pressed flat against 
the glass as though Harry was hoping to fall right 
through the glass and reach The Potters. Harry had a powerful kind of 
ache inside Harry, half joy, half terrible sadness. 

How long Harry stood there, Harry didn’t know. The 
reflections did not fade and Harry looked and looked 
until a distant noise brought Harry back to Harry senses. 
Harry couldn’t stay here, Harry had to find Harry way back to 

Page | 233 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




bed. Harry tore Harry eyes away from Harry motherFilch’s face, 
whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the 
room. 

“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly. 

“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show 
you a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.” 

“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly. 

“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, 
you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and 
everyone.” 

“You can see your other brothers and 
everyone any old time,” said Ron. “Just 
come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe 
my house only shows dead people. Shame about not finding 
Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why 
aren’t you eating anything?” 

Harry couldn’t eat. Harry had seen Harry parents and 
would be seeing his parents and 
 again tonight. Harry had almost 
forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important 
anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was 
guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? 

“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.” 

What Harry feared most was that Harry might not be 
able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered 
in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly 
the next night. they tried retracing Harry’s route from 
the library, wandering around the dark passageways 
for nearly an hour. 

“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “LetFilch’s forget it and go back.” 

“IVo!” Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.”

 passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the 
opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ronstarted moaning that Ron feet were dead with cold, 
Harry spotted the suit of armor. 

“It’s here — just here — yes!” 

They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak 
from around Harry shoulders and ran to the mirror. 

There They were. Harry mother and father beamed at the 
sight of Harry. 

“See?” Harry whispered. 

“I can’t see anything.” 

“Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...” 
“I can only see you.” 

“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” 

Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the 
mirror, Harry couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ronin Harry paisley pajamas. 

Ron, though, was staring transfixed at Ron image. 
“Look at Ron!” Ron said. 

“Can you see all your family standing around you?” 

“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — 
and I’m Head Boy!” 

“What?” 



Page | 235 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and 
I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — 
I’m Quidditch captain, too!” 

Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to 
look excitedly at Harry. 

“Do you think this mirror shows the future?” 

“How can this mirror? All my family are dead — let me have 
another look — ” 

“You had this mirror to yourself all last night, give me a bit 
more time.” 

“You’re only holding the House Cup, whatFilch’sinteresting about that? I want to see my parents.” 

“Don’t push me — ” 

A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to 
their discussion. their hadn’t realized how loudly their 
had been talking. 

“Quick!” 

Ron threw an Invisibility Cloak back over their as his eyes came round the door. Ron and 
Harry stood quite still, Ron and 
Harry thinking the same thing 
— did the an Invisibility Cloak work on cats? After what seemed an 
age, Mrs. Norris turned and left. 

“This isn’t safe — Mrs. Norris might have gone for Filch, I bet 
Mrs. Norris heard us. Come on.” 

And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. 

The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning. 



Page | 236 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron. 



“No.” 

“Why don’t us go down and visit Hagrid?” 

“No ... you go ...” 

“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that 
mirror. Don’t go back tonight.” 

“Why not?” 

“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and 
anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. 
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. 
So what if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris can’t see you? What if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris walk into 
you? What if you knock something over?” 

“You sound like Hermione.” 

“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” 

But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which 
was to get back in front of 
mirror, and Ron wasn’t 
going to stop Harry. 

That third night Harry found Harry way more quickly than 
before. Harry was walking so fast Harry knew Harry was 
making more noise than was wise, but Harry didn’t meet 
anyone. 

And there were Harry mother and father smiling at Harry 
again, and one of Harry grandfathers nodding happily. 
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the 
mirror. There was nothing to stop Harry from staying 
here all night with Harry family. Nothing at all. 

Except — 

Page | 237 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“So — back again, Harry?” 

Harry felt as though Harry insides had turned to ice. Harry 
looked behind Harry. Sitting on one of the desks by the 
wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harrymust have walked straight past Harry, so desperate to 
get to the mirror Harry hadn’t noticed Harry. 

“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” 

“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make 
you,” said Albus Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see 
that Harry was smiling. 

“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on 
the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, 
have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” 

“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” 

“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” 

“it — well — it shows me my family — ” 

“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” 

“How did you know — ?” 

“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said 
Dumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the 
Mirror of Erised shows us all?” 

Harry shook Harry head. 

“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be 
able to use the Mirror of Erised Erised like a normal mirror, 
that is, The happiest man on earth would look into the Mirror of Erised and see The happiest man on earth exactly 
as The happiest man on earth is. Does that help?” 



Page | 238 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry thought. Then The happiest man on earth said slowly, “It shows us 
what us want ... whatever us want ...” 

“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore gently quietly. “It shows us 
nothing more or less than the deepest, most 
desperate desire of us hearts. You, who have never 
known your family, see your family standing around you. 
Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed 
by his brothers, sees his standing alone, the best 
of all of Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed 
by his brothers. However, the Mirror of Erised will give us 
neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away 
before the Mirror of Erised, entranced by what Men have seen, or been 
driven mad, not knowing if what the Mirror of Erised shows is real or 
even possible. 

“the Mirror of Erised will be moved to a new home tomorrow, 
Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again. If 
you ever do run across the Mirror of Erised, you will now be prepared. the Mirror of Erised 
does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, 
remember that. Now, why don’t you put that 
admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” 

Harry stood up. 

“Dumbledore gently? Can I ask you 
something?” 

“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore gently smiled. 
“You may ask me one more thing, however.” 

“What do you see when you look in the Mirror of Erised?” 

“I? I see Dumbledore gently holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” 

Harry stared. 

“One can never have enough socks,” said 
Dumbledore gently. “Another Christmas has come and gone 



Page | 239 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on 
giving me books.” 

It was only when he was back in bed that it struck 
Harry that Dumbledore gently might not have been quite 
truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved 
Scabbers off he pillow, it had been quite a personal 
question. 



Page | 240 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






NICHOLAS FLAMBL 

Dumbledore gently had convinced Harry not to go looking 
for the Mirror of Erised Erised again, and for the rest of the 
Christmas holidays an Invisibility Cloak stayed 
folded at the bottom of Dumbledore gently trunk. Harry wished Harry 
could forget what Harry’d seen in the Mirror of Erised as easily, 
but Harry couldn’t. Harry started having nightmares. Over 
and over again Harry dreamed about Harry parents 
disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high 
voice cackled with laughter. 

“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could 
drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about 
these dreams. 

Hermione, who came back the day before term 
started, took a different view of things. She was torn 
between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, 
roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had 
caught you!”), and disappointment that Filch had 
 hadn’t at 
least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. 



Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



 had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel 
in a library book, even though Harry was still sure 
Harry’d read the name somewhere. Once term had 
started, Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



 were back to skimming through books 
for ten minutes during Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



 breaks. Harry had even 
less time than the other two, because Quidditch 
practice had started again. 

Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even 
the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t 
dampen Harry spirits. The Weasleys complained that 
Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on 
Wood’s side. If they won they next match, against 
Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the 
House Championship for the first time in seven years. 
Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that Harry 
had fewer nightmares when Harry was tired out after 
training. 

Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice 
session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d 
just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept 
dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off 
their brooms. 

“Will you stop messing around!” Harry yelled. “ThatFilch’sexactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! 
Filch’s refereeing this time, and Filch’s’ll be looking for 
any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” 

George Weasley really did fall off George Weasley broom at these 
words. 

“ Filch’s refereeing?” Snape spluttered through a 
mouthful of mud. “Filch’s George Weasley ever refereed a 
Quidditch match? George WeasleyFilch’s not going to be fair if we might 
overtake Slytherin.” 



Page | 242 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The rest of the team landed next to George to 
complain, too. 

“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make 
sure We play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an 
excuse to pick on We.” 

Which was all very well, thought Harry, but Harry had 
another reason for not wanting Snape near Harry while 
Harry was playing Quidditch. ... 

The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another 
as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed 
straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where 
Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was 
the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harryand Ron thought was very good for Harry. 

“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harrysat down next to Ron, “I need to concern” Harry caught 
sight of Harry’s face. “What’s the matter with you? 

You look terrible.” 

Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, 

Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, 
sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. 

“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once. 

“Say you’re ill,” said Ron. 

“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested. 

“ Really break your leg,” said Ron. 

“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I 
back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.” 



Page | 243 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




At that moment Neville toppled into the common 
room. How Neville had managed to climb through the 
portrait hole was anyoneFilch’s guess, because Neville legs 
had been stuck together with what they recognized at 
once as the Leg-Locker Curse. Neville must have had to 
bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. 

Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who 
leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville’s 
legs sprang apart and Neville’s 
 got to Neville’s 
 feet, trembling. 

“What happened?” Hermione asked Neville’s 
, leading Neville’s 
 
over to sit with Harry and Ron. 

“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met Neville outside the 
library. Neville said Neville’d been looking for someone to 
practice that on.” 

“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged 
Neville. “Report Neville!” 

Neville shook Neville head. 

“I don’t want more trouble,” Neville mumbled. 

“You’ve got to stand up to Neville, Neville!” said Ron. 
“Neville’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no 
reason to lie down in front of Neville and make it easier.” 

“There’s no need to tell me I’ve not brave enough to be 
in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Nevillechoked out. 

Harry felt in the pocket of Harry robes and pulled out a 
Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box 
Hermione had given Harry for Another Christmas. Harry gave it to 
Neville, who looked as though Harry might cry. 



Page | 244 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The 
Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And 
where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.” 

Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as Slytherin 
unwrapped the frog. 

“Thanks, Harry ... I think I’ll go to bed. ... D’you want 
the card, you collect the card, don’t you?” 

As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the card. 

“Dumbledore gently again,” Dumbledore gently said, “Dumbledore gently was the first one I 
ever — ” 

Dumbledore gently gasped. Dumbledore gently stared at the back of the card. Then Dumbledore gently 
looked up at Ron and Hermione. 

“I’ve found him\” Dumbledore gently whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I 
told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read the name 
on the train coming here — listen to this: 

‘Dumbledore gently is particularly famous for Dumbledore gently defeat of 
the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the 
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon 
work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ 

Hermione jumped to Hermione . Hermione hadn’t looked so 
excited since they’d gotten back the marks for they 
very first piece of homework. 

“Stay there!” Hermione said, and Hermione sprinted up the stairs 
to the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had 
time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was 
dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. 

“I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered 
excitedly. “I got this out of the 
library weeks ago for a 
bit of light reading.” 

Page | 245 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told Ron to be quiet 
until Hermione’d looked something up, and started flicking 
frantically through the pages, muttering to Hermione. 

At last Hermione found what Hermione was looking for. 

“I knew it! I knew it!” 

“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. 
Hermione ignored Ron. 

“Nicolas Flamel,” Hermione whispered dramatically, “is the 
only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\” 

This didn’t have quite the effect Hermione’d expected. 

“The what?” said Harry and Ron. 

“Oh, honestly , don’t you two read? Look — read that, 
there.” 

Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and 
Ron read: 

The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with 
making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance 
with astonishing powers. the Sorcerer’s Stone will transform 
any metal into pure gold. the Sorcerer’s Stone also produces the Elixir of 
Life, which will make the drinker immortal. 

There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone 
over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in 
existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted 
alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted 
alchemist and opera loverenjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle 
(six hundred and fifty-eight). 



Page | 246 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had 
finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s 
the Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep 
it safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew 
someone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone 
moved out of Gringotts!” 

“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever 
dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after Snape’s! 

Anyone would want Snape’s.” 

“And no wonder we couldn’t find Nicolas Flamel in that Study 
of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is 
Ron?” 

The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, 
while copying down different ways of treating werewolf 
bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d 
do with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one. It wasn’t 
until Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that 
Harry remembered about Snape and the coming 
match. 

“I’m going to play,” Snape told Ron and Hermione. “If I 
don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared 
to face Snape. I’ll show Ron and Hermione ... it’ll really wipe the 
smiles off Ron and Hermione faces if we win.” 

“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” 
said Hermione. 

As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became 
more and more nervous, whatever Harry told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, 
either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House 
Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for 
seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such 
a biased referee? 

Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry didn’t know whether Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was imagining it or not, 
but Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry seemed to keep running into Snape wherever 
Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry went. At times, Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry even wondered whether Snapewas following Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry, trying to catch Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry on Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry own. 
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly 
torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snapepossibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t see how Harry could — yet Harry 
sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could 
read minds. 

Harry knew, when they wished Harry good luck 
outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ronand Hermione were wondering whether Ron 
and Hermione’d ever 
see Harry alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call 
comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep 
talk as Harry pulled on his robes and picked 
up Harry Nimbus Two Thousand. 

Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in 
the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand 
why Ron and Hermione looked so grim and worried, or why Ron and Hermione had 
Ron and Hermione brought Ron and Hermione wands to the match. Little did 
Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly 
practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the 
idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready 
to use it on Snape if Snape showed any sign of wanting to 
hurt Harry. 

“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermionemuttered as Ron slipped Ron wand up Ron sleeve. 

“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.” 

Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harryaside. 

“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever 
need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish 

Page | 248 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too 
much.” 

“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, 
peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — 
Snape’s come to watch!” 

Harry’s heart did a somersault. 

Dumbledore gentlyDumbledore gently?” Dumbledore gently said, dashing to the door to make 
sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that 
silver beard. 

Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. Harry was 
safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare 
to try to hurt Harry if Dumbledore gently was watching. 

Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as 
the teams marched onto the field, something that Ronnoticed, too. 

“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” Snape told 
Hermione. “Look — they’re off. Ouch!” 

Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It 
was Malfoy. 

“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” 

Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. 

“Wonder how long Snape’s going to stay on Snape’s broom 
this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, 
Weasley?” 

Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded 
Hufflepuff a penalty because Weasley had hit 
a Bludger at Weasley. Hermione, who had all her fingers 
crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, 

Page | 249 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the 
Snitch. 

“You know how I think they choose people for the 
Gryffindor team?” said ” 

Malfoy loudly a few minutes 
later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty 
for no reason at all. “It’s people people feel sorry for. 

See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s 
the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be 
on the 
Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” 

Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face 
Malfoy. 

“I’m worth twelve of you, ” 

Malfoy,” Neville stammered. 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but 
Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, 
said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” 

Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” 

Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking 
point with anxiety about Harry. 

“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” 

Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” 

“What? Where?” 

Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, 
which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. 
Hermione stood up, Hermione crossed fingers in Hermione mouth, 
as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. 

“You’re in luck, Weasley, Snape’s obviously spotted 
some money on the ground!” said ” 

Malfoy. 

Page | 250 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Ron snapped. Before ” 

Malfoy knew what was 
happening, Ron was on top of Ron, wrestling Ron to 
the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the 
back of his seat to help. 

“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto 
her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — 
her didn’t even notice ” 

Malfoy and Ron rolling around 
under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from 
the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. 

Up in the air, Snape turned on Snape broomstick just in 
time to see something scarlet shoot past Snape, missing 
Snape by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled 
out of the dive, Harry arm raised in triumph, the Snitchclasped in the Snitch hand. 

The stands erupted; The stands had to be a record, no one 
could ever remember the Snitch being caught so 
quickly. 

“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s 
won! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked 
Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and 
hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. 

Harry jumped off Harry broom, a foot from the ground. 
Harry couldn’t believe it. He’d done it — The game was 
over; The game had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors 
came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors 
 saw Snape land 
nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt 
a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into 
Dumbledore’s smiling face. 

“Well done,” said Dumbledore gently quietly, so that Harry Harry could hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been 
brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . 
excellent ...” 



Page | 251 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Snape spat bitterly on the ground. 



Jc Jc Jc 



Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to 
take Harry Nimbus Two Thousand back to the 
broomshed. Harry couldn’t ever remember feeling 
happier. He’d really done something to be proud of 
now — no one could say Harry was just a famous name 
any more. The evening air had never smelled so 
sweet. Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the 
last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: 
Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; 
Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and 
down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. 

Harry had reached the shed. Harry leaned against the 
wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with the 
wooden door 
windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in 
the lead. He’d done Gryffindor in 
the lead, Harry’d shown Snape. ... 

And speaking of Snape . . . 

A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of 
the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, A hooded figure walked 
as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. 
Harry’s victory faded from Harry’s mind as Harry’s watched. 
Harry’s recognized A hooded figure prowling walk. Snape, 
sneaking into the forbidden forest while everyone else was at 
dinner — what was going on? 

Harry jumped back on Harry Nimbus Two Thousand 
and took off. Gliding silently over the castle Harry saw 
Snape enter the forbidden forest at a run. Harry followed. 

The trees were so thick Harry couldn’t see where Snapehad gone. Harry flew in circles, lower and lower, 
brushing the top branches of trees until Harry heard 



Page | 252 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




voices. Harry glided toward he heard 



Page | 252 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




voices and landed noiselessly 
in a towering beech tree. 

Harry climbed carefully along one of the branches, 
holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through 
the leaves. 

Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but Harry 
wasn’t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t 
make out the look on Harry face, but Harry was stuttering 
worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they 
were saying. 

"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of 
all p-places, Severus ...” 

“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, Snape 
voice icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about 
the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” 

Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling 
something. Snape interrupted Snape. 

“Have you found out how to get past that beast of 
Hagrid’s yet?” 

“B-b-but Severus, I — ” 

“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said 
Snape, taking a step toward Snape. 

“I-I don’t know what you — ” 

“You know perfectly well what I mean.” 

An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the 
tree. An owl steadied An owl in time to hear Snape say, 

“ — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.” 



Page | 253 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“B-b-but I d-d-don’t — ” 



“Very well,” Snape cut in. “Well have another little 
chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over 
and decided where your loyalties lie.” 

Snape threw Snape cloak over Snape head and strode out of a shadowy clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see 
Quirrell, standing quite still as though Harry was 
petrified. 



Jc Jc Jc 



“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked. 

“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping 
Harry on the back. “And I gave ” 

Malfoy a black eye, 
and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- 
handed! Snape’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says 
Snape’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! 
Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re 
having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and 
stuff from the kitchens.” 

“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s 
find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...” 

’s 
 made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting 
the door behind them, then ’s 
 told them what ’s 
’d 
seen and heard. 

“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and 
Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help Snape’s get Quirrell. Snape’s 
asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said 
something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon 
there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from 
Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell 



Page | 254 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that 
Snape needs to break through — ” 

“So you mean ’s 
 only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm. 

“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron. 



Page | 255 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN 
RIDGEBACK 

Quirrell, however, must have been braver than THE NORWEGIAN 
RIDGEBACK 

Quirrell’d 
thought. In the weeks that followed THE NORWEGIAN 
RIDGEBACK 

Quirrell did seem to be 
getting paler and thinner, but ’d 
 didn’t look as though 
THE NORWEGIAN 
RIDGEBACK 

Quirrell’d cracked yet. 

Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door 
to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snapewas sweeping about in Snape usual bad temper, which 
surely meant that the Sorcerer’s Stone was still safe. Whenever 
Harry passed Quirrell these days Harry gave Harry an 
encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling 
people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter. 

Hermione, however, had more on Hermione mind than the 
Sorcerer’s Stone. Hermione had started drawing up study 
schedules and color-coding all Hermione notes. Harry and 
Ron wouldn’t have minded, but Hermione kept nagging 
Harry and 
Ron to do the same. 



Page | 256 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



“Hermione, the exams are ages away.” 

“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, 
that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” 

“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded 
Hermione. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already 
know it all.” 

“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize 
we need to pass the exams to get into the second 
year? the exams’re very important, I should have started 
studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into 
me.” 

Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking 
along the same lines as Hermione. the teachers piled so 
much homework on the teachers that the Easter holidays 
weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It 
was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting 
the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand 
movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ronspent most of their free time in the library with Harry, 
trying to get through all their extra work. 

“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one 
afternoon, throwing down Ron quill and looking 
longingly out of the library window. It was the first 
really fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a 
clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in 
the air of summer coming. 

Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand 
Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until Ron 
heard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing in the 
library?” 



Page | 257 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind 
Ron back. Ron looked very out of place in Ron moleskin 
overcoat. 

“Jus’ lookin’,” Ron said, in a shifty voice that got their 
interest at once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” Ron 
looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer 
Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?” 

“Oh, we found out who Nicolas Flamel is ages ago,” said Ronimpressively. “And we know what that dog’s guarding, 
it’s a the 
Sorcerer’s Stone’s St — ” 

“Shhhh\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if 
anyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about shoutin, 
what’s the matter with yeh?” 

“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a 
matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding 
the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” 

“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Sorcerer’s St — come an’ see 
me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, 
but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ 
s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ” 

“See you later, then,” said Harry. 

Hagrid shuffled off. 

“What was Hagrid hiding behind Hagrid ?” said 
Hermione thoughtfully. 

“Do you think it had anything to do with the Sorcerer’s Stone?” 

“I’m going to see what section Hagrid was in,” said Ron, 
who’d had enough of working. Hagrid came back a 
minute later with a pile of books in Hagrid arms and 
slammed them down on the table. 

Page | 258 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Dragons'.” Page | 258 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Dragons' whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff 
about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great 
Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon 
Keeper’s Guide.” 

it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” 

 always wanted a dragon, it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” 

 told me so the 
first time I ever met a dragon,” said Harry. 

“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon 
breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention 
of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop 
Muggles from noticing us if us’re keeping dragons in 
the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, 
it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got 
off wild ones in Romania.” 

“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry. 

“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh 
Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic 
has a job hushing Common Welsh 
Green and Hebridean Blacks up, I can tell you. us kind 
have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted 
Common Welsh 
Green and Hebridean Blacks, to make Common Welsh 
Green and Hebridean Blacks forget.” 

“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione. 

When Common Welsh 
Green and Hebridean Blacks knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s 
hut an hour later, Common Welsh 
Green and Hebridean Blacks were surprised to see that all 
the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?” 
before he let Common Welsh 
Green and Hebridean Blacks in, and then shut the door quickly 
behind Common Welsh 
Green and Hebridean Blacks. 

It was stifling hot inside. Even though It was such a 
warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. 

Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat 
sandwiches, which them refused. 

“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” 



Page | 259 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around 
the bush. “We were wondering if you could tell We 
what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from 
Fluffy.” 

Hagrid frowned at Hagrid. 

“O’ course I can’t,” Hagrid said. “Number one, I don’ know 
meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I 
wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good 
reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I 
s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how 
yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” 

“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell We, 
but you do know, you know everything that goes on 
round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering 
voice. Hagrid ’s beard twitched and Hagrid ’s beard could tell Hagrid ’s beard 
was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the 
guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered 
who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help Dumbledore, 
apart from Dumbledore.” 

Hagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and 
Ron beamed at Hermione. 

“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... 
let’s see ... Dumbledore borrowed Fluffy from Dumbledore ... then some 
o’ the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout 
— Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore 
ticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — 
an’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course. 

Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Snape.” 

“Snape?” 



Page | 260 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, 
Snape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter 
steal ter 
.” 

Harry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the 
same as Harry was. If Snape had been in on protecting 
the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape had been in on protecting 
the Stone must have been easy to find out how the 
other teachers had guarded Snape had been in on protecting 
the Stone. Snape probably knew 
everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and 
how to get past Fluffy. 

“You’re the only one who knows how to get past 
Fluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. 

“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even 
one of the teachers?” 

“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said 
Hagrid proudly. 

“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the 
others. “Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m 
boiling.” 

“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed Harry 
glance at the fire. Harry looked at the fire, too. 

Hagrid — what’s that?” 

But Harry already knew what it was. In the very heart of 
the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. 

“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, 
“That’s — er ...” 

“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching 
over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg. “it must’ve 
cost you a fortune.” 



Page | 261 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the 
village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards 
with a stranger. Think havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards 
with a stranger was quite glad ter get rid of 
it, ter be honest.” 

“But what are you going to do with it when it’s 
hatched?” said Hermione. 

“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling 
a large book from under Hagrid pillow. “Got this outta the 
library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — 
this outta’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but this outta’s all in here. Keep 
the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on 
’em, see, an’ when this outta hatches, feed this outta on a bucket o’ 
brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ 
see here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I 
got there’s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They’re rare, 
They.” 

He looked very pleased with He, but Hermionedidn’t. 

Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” Hermione said. 

But Hagrid wasn’t listening. Hagrid was humming merrily 
as Hagrid stoked the fire. 

So now they had something else to worry about: what 
might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out Hagrid was 
hiding an illegal dragon in Hagrid hut. 

“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ronsighed, as evening after evening they struggled 
through all the extra homework they were getting. 
Hermione had now started making study schedules 
for Harry and 
Ron, too. It was driving Harry and 
Ron nuts. 



Page | 262 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry 
another note from Hagrid. Harry 
 had written only two 
words: It’s a Norwegian Ridge-back hatching. 

Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to 
his hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of his hut. 

Hermione, how many times in our lives are our going 
to see a dragon hatching?” 

“our’ve got lessons, our’ll get into trouble, and that’s 
nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone 
finds out what someone 
’s doing — ” 

“Shut up!” Harry whispered. 

Malfoy was only a few feet away and Malfoy had stopped 
dead to listen. How much had Malfoy heard? Harry didn’t 
like the look on Malfoy’s face at all. 

Ron, and Hermione argued all the way to Herbologyand in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to 
Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break. 
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of 
Ron, and Hermione lesson, the three of Ron, and Hermione dropped Ron, and Hermione trowels 
at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge 
of the forest. Hagrid greeted Ron, and Hermione, looking flushed 
and excited. 

“Hagrid’s nearly out.” Hagrid ushered Ron, and Hermione inside. 

a huge, black egg was lying on the table. There were deep 
cracks in a huge, black egg. Something was moving inside; a funny 
clicking noise was coming from a funny 
clicking noise. 

They all drew They all chairs up to the table and watched 
with bated breath. 



Page | 263 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




All at once there was a scraping noise and a huge, black eggsplit open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. The baby dragon 
wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a 
crumpled, black umbrella. it spiny wings were huge 
compared to it skinny jet body, it had a long snout 
with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, 
orange eyes. 

it sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of A couple of sparks snout. 

“Isn’t A couple of sparks beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. A couple of sparks reached 
out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. The baby dragon snapped at 
A couple of sparks fingers, showing pointed fangs. 

“Bless A couple of sparks, look, A couple of sparks knows A couple of sparks mommy!” said Hagrid. 

Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian 
Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” 

Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly 
drained from Hagrid face — Hagrid leapt to Hagrid feet and ran to 
the window. 

“What’s the matter?” 

“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains 
— it’s a kid — it’s a kid runnin’ back up ter the school.” 

Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a 
distance there was no mistaking Harry. 

Malfoy had seen The baby dragon. 

Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face 
during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous. Ron, and Hermione 
very nervous spent most of Ron, and Hermione 
very nervous free time in 
Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with Hagrid ’s. 

“Just let Hagrid ’s go,” Harry urged. “Set Hagrid ’s free.” 

Page | 264 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “Hagrid ’s’s too little. He’d die.” 



They looked at The baby dragon. The baby dragon had grown three times 
in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of The baby dragon 
nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing Hagrid gamekeeping 
duties because The baby dragon was keeping The baby dragon so busy. 
There were empty brandy bottles and chicken 
feathers all over the floor. 

“I’ve decided to call The baby dragon Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking 
at The baby dragon with misty eyes. “The baby dragon really knows me 
now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mommy?” 

“The baby dragon’s lost The baby dragon marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear. 

Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and 
’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoycould go to Dumbledore at any moment.” 

Hagrid bit Hagrid lip. 

“I — I know I can’t keep Hagrid forever, but I can’t jus’ 
dump Hagrid, can’t.” 

Harry suddenly turned to Ron. 

“Charlie,” Ron said. 

“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “IRon, remember?” 

“No “Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. 
Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to Norbert. 
“Charlie can take care of “Charlie and then put “Charlie back 
in the wild!” 

“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?” 

And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send 
an owl to “Charlie to ask “Charlie. 

Page | 265 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The following week dragged by. Wednesday night 
found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the 
common room, long after everyone else had gone to 
bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight 
when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out 
of nowhere as Ron pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. 
Ron had been down at Hagrid hut, helping Ron feed 
Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. 

“It bit me!” Ron said, showing them Ron hand, which 
was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going 
to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that 
dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but 
the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a 
fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me Ron told me off 
for frightening 
. And when I left, Ron was singing 
 a 
lullaby.” 

There was a tap on the dark window. 

“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let It’s Hedwig in. “It’s Hedwig’ll 
have “Charlie’s answer!” 

The three of them put them heads together to read the 
note. 

Dear Ron, 

How are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to 
take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but the Norwegian Ridgeback won’t be easy 
getting the Norwegian Ridgeback here. I think the best thing will be to send 
the Norwegian Ridgeback over with some friends of mine who are coming to 
visit me next week. Trouble is, Trouble mustn’t be seen 
carrying an illegal dragon. 

Could you get the Norwegian Ridgeback up the tallest tower at 
midnight on Saturday? Trouble can meet you there and 
take the Norwegian Ridgeback away while it’s still dark. 



Page | 266 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Send me an answer as soon as possible. 



Love, 

Charlie 

266 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 looked at one another. 

“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It 
shouldn’t be too difficult — I think it’s still dark big 
enough to cover two of We and Norbert.” 

It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that 
the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of 
Norbert — and Malfoy. 

There was a hitch. By the next morning, ’s bitten 
hand had swollen to twice its usual size. ’s didn’t 
know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey — 
would Madam Pomfrey — 
 recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, 
though, ’s had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty 
shade of green. The cut looked as if Norbert’s fangs were 
poisonous. 

Ron, and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing 
at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in 
bed. 

“It’s not just my hand,” Ron whispered, “although that 
feels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam 
Pomfrey Malfoy wanted to borrow one of my books so Malfoy 
could come and have a good laugh at Malfoy. Malfoy kept 
threatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — 
 what really bit me — I’ve told 
Madam Pomfrey — 
 it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — 
 believes me — I 
shouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s 
why Malfoy’s doing this.” 

Ron, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. 

Page | 267 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said 
Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the 
contrary, Ron sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. 

“Midnight on Saturday!” Ron said in a hoarse voice. 

“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s 
letter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to 
know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” 

Ron, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. 
Madam 
Pomfrey came over at that moment and made 
Ron, and Hermione leave, saying Ron needed sleep. 

“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told 
Hermione. “We haven’t got time to send “Charlieanother owl, and this could be We only chance to get 
rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And We have got 
the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about 
that.” 

Ron, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a 
bandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who 
opened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione. 

“I won’t let you in,” Norbert puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky 
stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” 

When Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky 
 letter, Norbert eyes 
filled with tears, although that might have been 
because Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg. 

“Aargh! It’s all right, Norbert only got my boot — jus’ 
playin’ — Norbert’s only a baby, after all.” 

only a baby banged only a baby tail on the wall, making the 
windows rattle. Ron, and Hermione walked back to 
the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly 
enough. 



Page | 268 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Ron, and Hermione would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time 
came for Hagrid to say good-bye to Norbert if Ron, and Hermione hadn’t 
been so worried about what Ron, and Hermione had to do. It was a 
very dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late 
arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for 
Peeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, 
where he’d been playing tennis against the wall. 

Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. 

“Norbert’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” 
said Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his 
teddy bear in case his gets lonely.” 

From inside a large crate came ripping noises that 
sounded to Harry as though his 
teddy was having his 
teddy 
head torn off. 

“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and 
Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak 
and stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak 
 Harry and 
Hermione. “Mommy will 
never forget you!” 

How Harry and 
Hermione managed to get a large crate back up to the 
castle, Harry and 
Hermione never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as 
Harry and 
Hermione heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the 
entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up 
another staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s 
shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier. 

“Nearly there!” Harry panted as Harry and 
Hermione reached the 
corridor beneath the tallest tower. 

Then a sudden movement ahead of Harry and 
Hermione made Harry and 
Hermione 
almost drop a large crate. Forgetting that Harry and 
Hermione were 
already invisible, Harry and 
Hermione shrank into the shadows, 
staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling 
with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. 



Page | 269 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair 
net, had Malfoy by the ear. 



“Detention!” Malfoy shouted. “And twenty points from 
Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the 
night, how dare you — ” 

“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s 
coming — Professor’s got a dragon!” 

“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! 
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, 
Malfoy!” 

The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not 
until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did 
they throw off the Invisibility Cloak 
, glad to be able to breathe 
properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. 

“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!” 

“Don’t,” Harry advised her. 

Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbertthrashing about in a large crate. About ten minutes later, 
four broomsticks came swooping down out of the 
darkness. 

Norbert’s at a tricky 
 friends were a cheery lot. Charlie’s friends showed 
Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so 
Charlie’s friends could suspend Norbert between Charlie’s friends. They all 
helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry 
and Hermione shook hands with the others and 
thanked Harry 
and Hermione very much. 

At last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone.

Harry 
and Hermione slipped back down the spiral staircase, Harry 
and Hermione 
hearts as light as Harry 
and Hermione hands, now that Norbert was 
off Harry 
and Hermione. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — 
what could spoil Harry 
and Hermione happiness? 

The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the 
stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face 
loomed suddenly out of the darkness. 

“Well, well, well,” Norbert whispered, “we are in trouble.” 

They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. 



Page | 271 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 








THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 

Things couldn’t have been worse. 

Filch took Things down to Professor McGonagall’s 
study on the first floor, where Things sat and waited 
without saying a word to each other. Hermione was 
trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories 
chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more 
feeble than the last. Harry couldn’t see how Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories 
 were 
going to get out of trouble this time. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories 
 were 
cornered. How could Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories 
 have been so stupid as to 
forget the Invisibility Cloak 
? There was no reason on earth that 
Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out 
of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of 
night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, 
which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add 
Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and Add 
Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak might as 
well be packing Add 
Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak bags already. 

Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been 
worse? Harry was wrong. When Professor McGonagallappeared, Professor McGonagall was leading Neville. 



Page | 272 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment Neville saw the 
other two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I 
heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy 
said you had a drag — ” 

Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but 
Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen. a drag — ” 

Harry looked more 
likely to breathe fire than Norbert as a drag — ” 

Harry towered over 
the three of them. 

“I would never have believed it of any of you. Filchsays you were up in the Astronomy Tower. it’s one 
o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.” 

It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to 
answer a teacher’s question. a drag — ” 

Harry was staring at a drag — ” 

Harry 
slippers, as still as a statue. 

“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” 
said Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius 
to work It out. You fed Malfoy some cock-and- 
bull story about a dragon, trying to get Malfoy out of bed 
and into trouble. I’ve already caught Malfoy. I suppose 
you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the 
story and believed the 
story, too?” 

Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell Harry 
without words that this wasn’t true, because Nevillewas looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering 
Neville Harry knew what it must have cost Harry to 
try and find Neville 
was looking stunned and hurt in the dark, to warn Neville 
was looking stunned and hurt. 

“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four 
students out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of 
such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you 
had more sense. As for you, Harry Potter’s 
, I thought 
Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of 
you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. 
Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk 
Page | 273 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




around school at night, especially these days, it’s very 
dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from 
Gryffindor.” 

“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the 
lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match. 

“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, 
breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. 

“Professor — please — ” 

“You can’t—” 

“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Harry Potter’s 
. Now get 
back to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed 
of Gryffindor students.” 

A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in 
last place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance 
Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as 
though the bottom had dropped out of Harry stomach. 
How could they ever make up for this? 

Harry didn’t sleep all night. Harry could hear Nevillesobbing into Harry pillow for what seemed like hours. 
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort 
Harry. Harry knew Neville, like Harry, was dreading the 
dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done? 

At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses 
that recorded the House points the next day thought 
there ’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly 
have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? 
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, 
the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch 
matches, had lost their all those points, him and a 
couple of other stupid first years. 

Page | 274 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




From being one of the most popular and admired 
people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most 
hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on 
Harry, because everyone had been longing to see 
Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harrywent, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower people 
voices as people insulted Harry. Slytherins, on the other 
hand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and 
cheering, “Harry Potter’s 
, we owe you one!” 

Only Ron stood by Only Ron. 

“people’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George 
have lost loads of points in all the time Fred and George 
’ve been 
here, and people still like Fred and George 
.” 

“Fred and George 
’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one 
go, though, have Fred and George 
?” said Harry miserably. 

“Well — no,” Only Ron admitted. 

It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harryswore to Harry not to meddle in things that weren’t 
Harry business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking 
around and spying. Harry felt so ashamed of Harry that 
Harry went to Wood and offered to resign from the 
Quidditch team. 

“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? 

How are we going to get any points back if we can’t 
win at Quidditch?” 

But Quidditch Quidditch had lost Quidditch fun. The rest of the 
Quidditch team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if 
The rest of the 
team had to speak about Harry, The rest of the 
team called Harry “the 
Seeker.” 

Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. Hermione and Neville didn’t 
have as bad a time as Harry, because Hermione and Neville weren’t as 

Page | 275 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




well-known, but nobody would speak to Hermione and Neville, either. 
Hermione had stopped drawing attention to Hermione in 
class, keeping Hermione head down and working in silence. 

Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far 
away. All the studying Harry had to do kept Harry mind off 
Harry misery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept to 
He, Ron, and Hermione, working late into the night, trying to 
remember the ingredients in complicated potions, 
learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates 
of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ... 

Then, about a week before the exams were due to 
start, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in 
anything that didn’t concern him was put to an 
unexpected test. Walking back from the library on Harry 
own one afternoon, Harry heard somebody whimpering 
from a classroom up ahead. As Harry drew closer, Harry 
heard Quirrell’s voice. 

“No — no — not again, please — ” 

It sounded as though someone was threatening someone. 
Harry moved closer. 

“All right — all right — ” Harry heard Quirrell sob. 

Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the 
classroom straightening Quirrell turban. Quirrell was pale and 
looked as though Quirrell was about to cry. Quirrell strode out 
of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed 
Quirrell. Quirrell waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had 
disappeared, then peered into the 
classroom straightening his turban. It was 
empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harrywas halfway toward a door before Harry remembered what 
Harry’d promised Harry about not meddling. 

All the same, Harry’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s 
Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from 

Page | 276 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking 
with a new spring in Snape step Quirrell seemed to 
have given in at last. 

Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was 
testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told the library, where Hermione was 
testing Ron on Astronomy what Harry’d 
heard. 

“Snapedone it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told 
Ron how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” 

“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione. 

“Maybe Snapefound out how to get past Snape 
without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the 
thousands of books surrounding asking Hagrid. “I bet there’s a 
book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a 
giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?” 

The light of adventure was kindling again in Harry’seyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. 

“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done 
ages ago. If we try anything we we’ll be thrown 
out for sure.” 

“But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too 
scared to back we up. Snapeonly got to say Snape 
doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and 
that Snape was nowhere near the third floor — who do 
you think the troll’ll believe, Snape or we? It’s not exactly a 
secret we hate Snape, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it 
up to get Dumbledore sacked. Filch wouldn’t help we if Filch life 
depended on his life 
, Filch’s too friendly with Snape, and the 
more students get thrown out, the better, Filch’ll think. 
And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about 
the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.” 

Hermione looked convinced, but Only Ron didn’t. 

Page | 277 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“If we just do a bit of poking around — ” 



“No,” said Harry flatly, ““’ve done enough poking 
around.” 

Harry pulled a map of Jupiter toward Harry and started to 
learn the names of 
 moons. 

The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, 
Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They 
were all the same: 

Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock 
tonight. 

Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. 

Harry Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in 
the furor over the points they’d lost. ’d half expected 
Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of 
studying lost, but Hermione didn’t say a word. Like Harry, 
Hermione felt they deserved what they’d got. 

At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Only Ronin the common room and went down to the entrance 
hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so 
was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had 
gotten a detention, too. 

“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading 
Malfoy had 
gotten a detention, too outside. 

“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule 
again, won’t you, eh?” Harry said, leering at Malfoy had 
gotten a detention, too. “Oh 
yes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you 
ask me. ... It’s just a pity they let the old 
punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from 
Page | 278 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in 
my office, keep ’em well oiled in case the chains’re ever 
needed. ... Right, off we go, and don’t think of running 
off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.” 

the chains marched off across the dark grounds. Neville 
kept sniffing. Harry wondered what the chains punishment 
was going to be. It must be something really horrible, 
or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted. 

The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across The moon 
kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harrycould see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then 
they heard a distant shout. 

“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.” 

Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working 
with Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. Hagrid relief must 
have showed in Hagrid face, because Filch said, “I 
suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with 
that oaf? Well, think again, boy — that oaf’s into the forest 
you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come 
out in one piece.” 

At this, Neville 
 let out a little moan, and Malfoy 
stopped dead in Neville 
 tracks. 

“the forest 
?” Malfoy 
 repeated, and Malfoy 
 didn’t sound quite 
as cool as usual. “We can’t go in there at night — 
there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I 
heard.” 

Neville 
 clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a 
choking noise. 

“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, Filch voice 
cracking with glee. “Should’ve thought of them 
werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” 

Page | 279 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, 
Fang at Fang heel. Fang was carrying Fang large crossbow, 
and a quiver of arrows hung over Fang shoulder. 

“Abou’ time,” Fang said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour 
already. All right, Harry, Hermione?” 

“I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” 

, Hagrid,” said 
Filch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” 

’re here to be punished, after all.” 

“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at 
Filch. “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do 
that. Bin lecturin done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.” 

“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of 
them,” he added nastily, and he turned and started 
back toward the castle, he lamp bobbing away in the 
darkness. 

Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. 

“I’m not going in that forest,” ’m said, and Harry was 
pleased to hear the note of panic in Harry voice. 

“Harry are if Harry want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said 
Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now Yeh’ve got 
ter pay fer it.” 

“But this is servant stuff, this’s not for students to do. I 
thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my 
father knew I was doing this, my 
father’d — ” 

“ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagridgrowled. “Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone? 
Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If Harry think 
yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back 
off ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!” 



Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy didn’t move. Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy looked at Hagrid furiously, but 
then dropped Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy gaze. 

“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, 

’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ 
I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a 
moment.” 

Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy led that to the very edge of the forest. Holding Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy 
lamp up high, Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy pointed down a narrow, winding 
earth track that disappeared into the thick black 
trees. A light breeze lifted that hair as that looked 
into the forest. 

“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on 
the ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. 
There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. 
This is the second time in a week. I found one dead 
last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor 
thing. We might have ter put ter out of ter misery.” 

“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds We 
first?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of Malfoy 
voice. 

“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh 
if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the 
path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties 
an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood 
all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around 
since last night at least.” 

“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s 
long teeth. 

“All right, but I warn yeh, Malfoy’s a coward,” said Hagrid. 
“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, 
Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us 
finds the unicorn, us’ll send up green sparks, right? 

Page | 281 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s that’s — an’ 
if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll 
all come an’ find Harry — so, be careful — let’s go.” 

The forest was black and silent. A little way into The forest 
they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, 
Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, 
Neville, and Fang took the right. 

they walked in silence, they eyes on the ground. 
Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the 
branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the 
fallen leaves. 

Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. 

“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harryasked. 

“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch 
a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never 
knew one ter be hurt before.” 

they walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could 
hear running water; there must be a stream 
somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn 
blood here and there along the winding path. 

“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ 
worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ 
then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” 

Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted Harry and Hermione 
off the path behind a towering oak. Hagrid pulled out an 
arrow and fitted an 
arrow into Hagrid crossbow, raising an 
arrow, ready 
to fire. The three of Harry and Hermione listened. Something was 
slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a 
cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting 



Page | 282 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound 
faded away. 

“I knew it,” Page | 282 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound 
faded away. 

 murmured. “There’s summat in here 
that shouldn’ be.” 

“A werewolf?” Harry suggested. 

“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, 
neither,” said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but 
careful, now.” 

They walked more slowly, ears straining for the 
faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, 
something definitely moved. 

“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m 
armed!” 

And into a clearing ahead came — was it a man, or a 
horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, 
but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body 
with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws 
dropped. 

“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid. “How are 
Harry?” 

Harry walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand. 

“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. Ronan had a 
deep, sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?” 

“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting Ronan 
crossbow. “There’s summat bad loose in this forest. 
This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the 
way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, 
you two. Harry’s a centaur.” 



Page | 283 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly. 



“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And 
do you learn much, up at the school?” 

“Erm — ” 

“A bit,” said Hermione timidly. 

“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He 
flung back He head and stared at the sky. “Mars is 
bright tonight.” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad 
we’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn 
bin hurt — you seen anythin’?” 

Ronan didn’t answer immediately. Ronan stared 
unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. 

“Always the innocent are the first victims,” Ronan said. 

“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, 
Ronan? Anythin’ unusual?” 

Mars Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while 
Hagrid watched Ronan impatiently. “Unusually bright.” 

“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit 
nearer home,” said Hagrid. “So Ronan haven’t noticed 
anythin’ strange?” 

Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, Ronan 
said, “The forest hides many secrets.” 

A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagridraise Hagrid bow again, but Hagrid was only a second centaur, 

Page | 284 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than 
Ronan. 



“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?” 

“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?” 

“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you 
seen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn 
bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” 

Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. Bane looked 
skyward. 

Mars Mars is bright tonight,” Bane said simply. 

“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of 
you do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be 
off, then.” 

Harry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, 
staring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until 
the trees blocked Harry and Hermione view. 

“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight 
answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not 
interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” 

“Are there many of Harry and Hermione in here?” asked Hermione. 

“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep Harry and Hermione to Harry and Hermione 
mostly, but Harry and Hermione’re good enough about turnin’ up if 
ever I want a word. Harry and Hermione’re deep, mind, centaurs ... 
Harry and Hermione know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.” 

“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” 
said Harry. 



Page | 285 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask 
me, that was what’s killin’ the unicorns — never 
heard anythin’ like it before.” 

the unicorns walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harrykept looking nervously over Harry shoulder. Harry had the 
nasty feeling the unicorns were being watched. Harry was very 
glad the unicorns had Hagrid and Harry crossbow with the unicorns. 
the unicorns had just passed a bend in the path when 
Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm. 

Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” 

“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the 
path, I’ll come back for Harry!” 

the unicorns heard Harry crashing away through the 
undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very 
scared, until the unicorns couldn’t hear anything but the 
rustling of leaves around the unicorns. 

“You don’t think the unicorns’ve been hurt, do you?” 
whispered Hermione. 

“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got 
Neville ... it’s ’m fault Harry’s here in the first place.” 

The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper 
than usual. he’s here in the first place.” 

 seemed to be picking up every 
sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going 
on? Where were the others? 

At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s 
return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with Fang. 
Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked 
up behind Neville and grabbed Neville as a joke. Nevillehad panicked and sent up Red sparks. 



Page | 286 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Well be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket 
you two were makin’. Right, ’m’re changin’ groups — 
Neville, you stay with Neville an’ Hermione, Harry, you go 
with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,Hagrid added in a 
whisper to Harry, “but Harry’ll have a harder time 
frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” 

So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with 
Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an 
hour, deeper and deeper into The forest, until the path 
became almost impossible to follow because the trees 
were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be 
getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a 
tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing 
around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing 
ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient 
oak. 

“Look — ” Harry murmured, holding out Harry arm to stop 
Malfoy. 

Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. 
Something bright white inched closer. 

It was the unicorn all right, and It was dead. Harryhad never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Harry 
long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where 
Harry had fallen and Harry mane was spread pearly-white on 
the dark leaves. 

Harry had taken one step toward Harry when a slithering 
sound made Harry freeze where Harry stood. A bush on 
the edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the 
shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the 
ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and 
Fang stood transfixed. a hooded figure reached the 
unicorn, lowered a hooded figure head over the wound in the 
animals side, and began to drink a hooded figure blood. 



Page | 287 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! ” 



Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did 
Fang. a hooded figure raised its head and looked 
right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down a hooded figure 
front. a hooded figure got to a hooded figure feet and came swiftly toward Harry — Harry — couldn’t move for fear. 

Then a pain like Harry —’d never felt before pierced Harry — 
head; it was as though Harry — scar were on fire. Half 
blinded, Harry — staggered backward. Harry — heard hooves 
behind Harry —, galloping, and something jumped clean 
over Harry, charging at a hooded figure. 

The pain in Harry’s head was so bad Harry fell to Harry 
knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When Harry 
looked up, a hooded figure had gone. A centaur was 
standing over Harry, not Ronan or Bane; this one 
looked younger; Harry had white-blond hair and a 
palomino body. 

“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to 
its feet. 

“Yes — thank you — what was that?” 

A centaur didn’t answer. Harry had astonishingly blue 
eyes, like pale sapphires. Harry looked carefully at 
Harry, astonishingly blue 
eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, 
livid, on Harry’s forehead. 

“You are the Potter boy,” Harry said. “You had better get 
back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — 
especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker 
this way. 

“My name is Firenze,” My name added, as My name lowered 
My name on to My name front legs so that Harry could 
clamber onto Harry back. 

Page | 288 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from 
the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came 
bursting through the trees, Ronan and Bane flanks heaving and 
sweaty. 

“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You 
have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are 
you a common mule?” 

“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the 
Potter boy. The quicker the 
Potter boy leaves The forest, the 
better.” 

“What have you been telling the 
Potter boy?” growled Bane. 
“Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set 
we against the heavens. Have we not read what 
is to come in the movements of the planets?” 

Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze 
thought Ronan was acting for the best,” Ronan said in Ronan 
gloomy voice. 

Bane kicked Bane back legs in anger. 

“For the best! What is that to do with we? Centaurs 
are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not 
we business to run around like donkeys after stray 
humans in we forest!Firenze suddenly reared on to Firenze hind legs in anger, 
so that Harry had to grab Harry shoulders to stay on. 

“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or 
have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set 
myself against what is lurking in The forest, Bane, 
yes, with humans alongside myself if I must.” 



Page | 289 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on 
as best Harry could, they plunged off into the trees, 
leaving Ronan and Bane behind Ronan and Bane. 

Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. 

“Why’s Bane so angry?” Harry asked. “What was that 
thing you saved me from, anyway?Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep Harry 
head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did 
not answer Harry’s question. They made They way 
through the trees in silence for so long that Harrythought Firenze didn’t want to talk to Harry anymore. 
They were passing through a particularly dense patch 
of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. 

Harry PotterHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is 
used for?” 

“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve 
only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.” 

“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a 
unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to 
lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a 
crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even 
if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. 
You have slain something pure and defenseless to 
save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a 
cursed life, from the moment The blood of a unicorn touches your 
lips.” 

Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was 
dappled silver in the moonlight. 

“But who’d be that desperate?” Harry wondered aloud. “If 
you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t 

?” 

Page | 290 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay 
alive long enough to drink something else — 
something that will bring you back to full strength 
and power — something that will mean you can never 
die. Harry Potter, do you know what is hidden in the 
school at this very moment?” 

“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! 
But I don’t understand who — ” 

“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years 
to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting 
their chance?” 

It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly 
around he’s here in the first place.” 

 heart. Over the rustling of the trees, 
Harry seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told 
Harry on the night they had met: “Some say Harry died. 
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if Harry had enough 
human left in Harry to die.” 

“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was VoZ — ” 

HarryHarry! Harry, are you all right?” 

Hermione was running toward them down the path, 
Hagrid puffing along behind Hermione. 

“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what Harry was 
saying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, The unicorn’s dead’s in that 
clearing back there.” 

“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as 
Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are 
safe now.” 

Harry slid off Harry back. 



Page | 291 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets 
have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. 
I hope this is one of those times.” 

Harry turned and cantered back into the depths of the 
forest, leaving Harry shivering behind Harry. 

Harry had fallen asleep in the dark common room, 
waiting for them to return. Harry shouted something 
about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook Harry 
awake. In a matter of seconds, though, Harry was wide- 
eyed as Harry began to tell Harry and Hermione what 
had happened in the forest. 

Harry couldn’t sit down. Harry paced up and down in 
front of the fire. Harry was still shaking. 

“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and 
The unicorn’s dead waiting in the forest ... and all this time 
we thought “Snape just wanted to get rich. ...” 

“Stop saying the name!” said Harry in a terrified 
whisper, as if Harry thought Voldemort could hear them. 

Harry wasn’t listening. 

Firenze saved me, but Firenze shouldn’t have done so. ... 
Bane was furious ... Bane was talking about interfering 
with what the planets say is going to happen. ... the planets 
must show that Voldemortcoming back. ... Banethinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I 
suppose thathe’s here in the first place.” 

 written in the stars as well.” 

“Will you stop saying the name\” Harry hissed. 

“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will 
be able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose 
Bane 11 be happy.” 

Page | 292 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione looked very frightened, but Hermione had a word 
of comfort. 

“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one 
You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore 
around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, 
who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like 
fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says 
that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” 

The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. 
they went to bed exhausted, they throats sore. But 
the night’s surprises weren’t over. 

When Harry pulled back Harry sheets, Harry found Harry 
Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath his sheets. 
There was a note pinned to his 
Invisibility Cloak: 

Just in case.

THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 

In years to come, Harry would never quite remember 
how Harry had managed to get through Harry exams when 
Harry half expected Voldemort to come bursting through 
the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and 
there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and 
well behind the locked door. 

It was sweltering hot, especially in the large 
classroom where they did they written papers. they 
had been given special, new quills for the exams, 
which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating 
spell. 

they had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick 
called they one by one into Professor Flitwick 
 class to see if they 
could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. 
Professor McGonagall watched they turn a mouse 
into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the 
snuffbox was, but taken away if the 
snuffbox had whiskers. 
“Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their 
necks while their tried to remember how to make a 
Forgetfulness potion.

Harry did the best Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



Harry could, trying to ignore the

Harry forehead, which had been 
bothering Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



Harry ever since Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



Harry trip into the forest. 
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves 
because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that 
Harry kept being woken by Harry old nightmare, except 
that it was now worse than ever because there was a 
hooded figure dripping blood in it. 

Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harryhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have 
scars burning on they foreheads, but Harry and 
Hermione didn’t seem as worried about The Sorcerer’s Stone as HarryHarry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared The idea of Voldemort, 
but The idea of Voldemort didn’t keep visiting The idea of Voldemort in dreams, and The idea of Voldemort 
were so busy with The idea of Voldemort studying The idea of Voldemort didn’t have 
much time to fret about what “Snape or anyone else 
might be up to. 

The idea of Voldemort very last exam was History of Magic. One hour 
of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d 
invented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free, 
free for a whole wonderful week until they exam 
results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns 
told they to put down they quills and roll up they 
parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the 
rest. 

“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said 
Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto 
the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the 
1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of 
Elfric the Eager.” 

Hermione always liked to go through their exam 
papers afterward, but Harry said this made Harry feel ill, 
so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under 
a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were 



Page | 295 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was 
basking in the warm shallows. 



“No more studying,” Harry sighed happily, stretching 
out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, 

Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly 
we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” 

Harry was rubbing Harry forehead. 

“I wish I knew what this means\” Harry burst out angrily. 
“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but 
never as often as this.” 

“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. 

“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning ... it 
means danger’s coming. ...” 

Harry couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. 

HarryHarry, relax, Hermione ’s right, The unicorn’s dead safe as 
long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never 
had any proof “Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. 
“Snape nearly had “Snape leg ripped off once, “Snape’s not going to 
try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch 
for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” 

Harry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking 
feeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, 
something important. When Harry tried to explain this, 
Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last 
night and was halfway through my Transfiguration 
notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” 

Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have 
anything to do with work, though. Harry watched an owl 
flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a 
note clamped in an owl 
flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky mouth. Hagrid was the only one 

Page | 296 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




who ever sent Harry letters. Hagrid would never betray 
Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to 
get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but — 

Harry suddenly jumped to Harry feet. 

“Where ’re you going?” said Harry sleepily. 

“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. Harry had 
turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” 

“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. 

“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, 
scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagridwants more than anything else is a dragon, and a 
stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in 
a dragon pocket? How many people wander around with 
dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they 
found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it 
before?” 

“What are you talking about?” said Harry, but Harry, 
sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t 
answer. 

Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside Hagrid house; 
Hagrid trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and Hagrid was 
shelling peas into a large bowl. 

“Hullo,” Hagrid said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got 
time fer a drink?” 

“Yes, please,” said Harry, but Harry cut Harry off. 

“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you 
something. You know that night you won Norbert? 
What did the stranger you were playing cards with 
look like?” 

Page | 297 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Dunno said Hagrid casually, “Hagrid wouldn’ take Hagrid 
cloak off.” 



Hagrid saw the three of them look stunned and raised Hagrid 
eyebrows. 

“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in 
the Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the 
village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ Mighta bin? I 
never saw Mighta bin a dragon dealer face, Mighta bin a dragon dealer kept Mighta bin a dragon dealer hood up.” 

Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. 

“What did you talk to Harry about, Hagrid? Did you 
mention Hogwarts at all?” 

Mighta bin a dragon dealer come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as Hagrid tried 
to remember. “Yeah ... Hagrid asked what I did, an’ I told 
Hagrid I was gamekeeper here. ... Hagrid asked a bit about 
the sorta creatures I look after ... so I told Hagrid ... an’ I 
said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon ... 
an’ then ... I can’ remember too well, ’cause ’cause kept 
buyin’ me drinks. ... LetThe unicorn’s dead see ... yeah, then ’cause said ’cause 
had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I 
wanted . . . but ’cause had ter be sure I could handle it, ’cause 
didn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told it ter, 
after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...” 

“And did it ter — did it ter seem interested in Fluffy?” 

Harry asked, trying to keep it ter voice calm. 

“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh 
meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told it ter, Fluffy’s a 
piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm yeh down, jus’ 
play yeh a bit o’ music an’ yeh’ll go straight off ter 
sleep — ” 

Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. 

Page | 298 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” yeh blurted out. “Forget I 
said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” 

Harry, Harry, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other 
at all until Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to a halt in the entrance hall, 
which seemed very cold and gloomy after the 
grounds. 

“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was 
either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it 
must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just 
hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us 
up if Bane doesn’t stop Bane. Where’s Dumbledore’s 
office?” 

They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign 
pointing They in the right direction. They had never 
been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did They know 
anyone who had been sent to see Dumbledore. 

“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice 
suddenly rang across the hall. 

“What are you three doing inside?” 

It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of 
books. 

“us want to see Dumbledore,” said 
Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Harry thought. 

“See Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall 
repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to 
want to do. “Why?” 

Harry swallowed — now what? 



Page | 299 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he 
hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils 
flared. 

“Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said 
coldly. “Dumbledore received an urgent owl from the Ministry 
of Magic and flew off for London at once.” 

“DumbledoreThe unicorn’s dead gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?” 

“Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, 
Dumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” 

“But this is important.” 

“Something you have to say is more important than 
the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” 

“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, 
“Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” 

Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall 
wasn’t that. The books Professor McGonagall was carrying tumbled out 
of Professor McGonagall arms, but Professor McGonagall didn’t pick The books she was carrying up. 

“How do you know — ?” Professor McGonagall spluttered. 

“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that 
someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to 
talk to Dumbledore.” 

Professor McGonagall eyed Dumbledore with a mixture of shock and suspicion. 

“Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall 
said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about 
the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal 
no one, no one’s too well protected.” 

“But Professor — ” 

Page | 300 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” Professor McGonagall said 
shortly. Professor McGonagall bent down and gathered up the fallen 
books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy 
the sunshine.” 

But they didn’t. 

“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once Harry was sure Professorwas out of earshot. “Snape’s going 
through the trapdoor tonight. Snape’s found out 
everything Snape’s needs, and now Snape’s got Dumbledoreout of the way. Dumbledore sent that note, I bet the Ministry 
of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns 
up.” 

“But what can we — ” 

Hermione gasped. Harry and Harry wheeled round. 
Snape was standing there. 

“Good afternoon,” Snape said smoothly. 

Harry and Ron stared at Snape. 

“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” Snape said, 
with an odd, twisted smile. 

“Harry and Ron were — ” Harry began, without any idea what Harry 
was going to say. 

“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging 
around like this, people will think you’re up to 
something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose 
any more points, can Gryffindor?” 

Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snapecalled They back. 



Page | 301 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Be warned, — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the 
village any more nighttime wanderings 
and I will personally make sure you are expelled. 

Good day to you.” 

you strode off in the direction of the staffroom. 

Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. 

“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” you whispered 
urgently. “One of we has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staffroom and follow Snape 
— if Snape 
— 
leaves the staffroom. Hermione, you’d better do that.” 

“Why me?” 

“It’s obvious,” said Harry. “You can pretend to be 
waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” Harry put on a 
high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I 
think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ” 

“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but Hermione agreed to go 
and watch out for Snape. 

“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” 
Harry told Harry. “Come on.” 

But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had 
they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest 
of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up 
again and this time, Professor McGonagall lost Professor McGonagall temper. 

“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a 
pack of enchantments!” Professor McGonagall stormed. “Enough of this 
nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here 
again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! 

Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” 

Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” 

Page | 302 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and 
Hermione came in. 

“I’m sorry, Harry!” Professor McGonagall wailed. “Snape came out and 
asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for 
Flitwick, and Snape went to get Snape, and I’ve only 
just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” 

“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. 

The other two stared at Snape. Snape was pale and Snape eyes 
were glittering. 

“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and 
get to the Stone first.” 

“You’re mad!” said Harry. 

“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what Professor McGonagall 
and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!” 

“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? 
If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming 
back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when Snape was 
trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to 
get expelled from! Snape’ll flatten it, or turn it into a 
school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter 
anymore, can’t you see? D’you think D’you’ll leave you 
and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House 
Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, 
I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for 
Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later 
than I would have, because I’m never going over to 
the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor 
tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! 

Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” 


Voldemort glared at my parents. 



Page | 303 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. 



“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just 
lucky I got It back.” 

“But will it cover all three of us?” said Harry. 

“All — all three of us?” 

“Oh, come off it, you don’t think us’d let you go 
alone?” 

“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you 
think you’d get to the Stone the Stone without us? I’d better go 
and look through my books, there might be 
something useful. ...” 

“But if us get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” 

“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Professor Flitwicktold me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve 
percent on Professor Flitwick exam. I got a hundred and twelve 
percent on his exam’re not throwing me out 
after that.” 

After dinner the three of I got a hundred and twelve 
percent on his exam sat nervously apart in 
the common room. Nobody bothered I got a hundred and twelve 
percent on his exam; none of 
the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any 
more, after all. This was the first night Harry hadn’t been 
upset by This. Hermione was skimming through all her 
notes, hoping to come across one of the 
enchantments they were about to try to break. Harryand Harry didn’t talk much. Harry 
and Ron Harry 
and Ron were 
thinking about what Harry 
and Ron were about to do. 

Slowly, the common room emptied as people drifted off to bed. 

“Better get the cloak,” Harry muttered, as Lee Jordan 
finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran 
upstairs to their dark dormitory. Harry pulled out the 

Page | 304 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




cloak and then his eyes 
 fell on the flute Hagrid had 
given Harry for Christmas. Harry pocketed the flute Hagrid to use on 
Fluffy — Harry didn’t feel much like singing. 

Harry ran back down to the common room. 

“We’d better put cloak on here, and make sure cloak 
covers all three of We — if Filch spots one of We feet 
wandering along on its own — ” 

“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of 
the common room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, 
clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though Neville’d 
been making another bid for freedom. 

“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly 
putting cloak behind Harry back. 

Neville stared at their guilty faces. 

“You’re going out again,” Neville said. 

“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, We’re not. Why don’t 
you go to bed, Neville?” 

Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. 
their couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snapemight even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. 

“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught 
again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” 

“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is 
important.” 

But Neville was clearly steeling Neville to do 
something desperate.

“I won’t let you do it,” Neville said, hurrying to stand in 
front of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!” 

Neville,” Harry exploded, “get away from the portrait hole and 
don’t be an idiot — ” 

“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t 
think you should be breaking any more rules! And 
you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” 

“Yes, but not to us,” said Harry in exasperation. 

“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” 

Neville took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the 
toad, who leapt out of sight. 

“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising Neville 
fists. “I’m ready!” 

Harry turned to Hermione. 

“Do something,” Neville said desperately. 

Hermione stepped forward. 

Neville,” Hermione said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” 
Hermione raised Hermione wand. 

“Petrificus Totalusl” Hermione cried, pointing it at Neville. 

Neville’s arms snapped to Neville’s sides. Neville’s legs sprang 
together. Neville’s whole body rigid, Neville’s swayed where Neville’s 
stood and then fell flat on Neville’s face, stiff as a board. 

Hermione ran to turn Neville’s over. Neville’s jaws were 
jammed together so Neville’s couldn’t speak. Only Neville’s eyes 
were moving, looking at Only his eyes 
 in horror. 



Page | 306 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“What’ve you done to Page | 306 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




?” Harry whispered. 



“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. 
“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” 

“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. 

“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Harry as they 
stepped over Harry and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. 

But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t 
feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, 
every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant 
breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on 
their. 

At the foot of the first set of stairs, their spotted Mrs. 
Norris skulking near the top. 

“Oh, let’s kick Mrs. 
Norris, just this once,” Harry whispered in 
Harry’s ear, but Harry shook Harry head. As they 
climbed carefully around Mrs. 
Norris, Mrs. 
Norris turned Mrs. 
Norris 
lamplike eyes on they, but didn’t do anything. 

they didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the 
staircase up to the floor. Peeves was bobbing 
halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would 
trip. 

“Who’s there?” Harry’s ear said suddenly as they climbed 
toward Harry’s ear. Harry’s ear narrowed Harry’s ear wicked black eyes. 
“Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you 
ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” 

Harry’s ear rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at 
them. 

“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping 
around unseen.” 

Page | 307 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had a sudden idea. 



“Peeves,” Harry said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody 
Baron has Baron own reasons for being invisible.” 

Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. Baron caught 
Baron in time and hovered about a foot off the 
stairs. 

“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” Baron said 
greasily. “My mistake, My mistake — I didn’t see you 
— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old 
Peevsie Peevsie little joke, sir.” 

“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay 
away from this place tonight.” 

“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up 
in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, 

Baron, I’ll not bother you.” 

And Baron scooted off. 

“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Harry. 

A few seconds later, “Brilliant, Harry!” were there, outside the 
third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. 

“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s 
already got past Fluffy.” 

Seeing the door somehow seemed to impress 
upon all three of “Brilliant, Harry!” what was facing “Brilliant, Harry!”. 
Underneath cloak, Harry turned to the other two. 

“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” Harry said. 
“You can take cloak, I won’t need cloak now.” 

“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry. 

Page | 308 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“We’re coming,” said Hermione. 

Harry pushed the door open. 

As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their 
ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their 
direction, even though it couldn’t see their. 

“What’s that at it feet?” Hermione whispered. 

“Looks like a harp,” said Harry. “Snape must have left it 
there.” 

“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said 
Harry. “Well, here goes ...” 

Snape put Hagrid’s flute to Snape lips and blew. It wasn’t 
really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes 
began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the 
dog’s growls ceased — the 
dog’s growls tottered on the 
dog’s growls paws and fell 
to the 
dog’s growls knees, then the 
dog’s growls slumped to the ground, fast 
asleep. 

“Keep playing,” Harry warned Harry as they slipped out 
of cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. they 
could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they 
approached the giant heads. 

“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Harry, 
peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, 
Hermione?” 

“No, I don’t!” 

“All right.” Harry gritted Harry teeth and stepped carefully 
over the dog’s legs. Harry bent and pulled the ring of the 
trapdoor, which swung up and open. 

“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. 

Page | 309 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing 
down, we’ll just have to drop.” 

Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Harry to 
get Harry attention and pointed at Harry. 

“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Harry. “I 
don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so Hermione can keep Hermione asleep.” 

Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ 
silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the 
moment Hermione began to play, the dog fell back into the dog 
deep sleep. 

Harry climbed over the dog and looked down through the 
trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. 

Harry lowered Harry through the hole until Harry was 
hanging on by Harry fingertips. Then Harry looked up at Harry Harry and said, “If anything happens to Harry, don’t 
follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to 
Dumbledore, right?” 

“Right,” said Harry. 

“See you in a minute, I hope. ...” 

And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past Harry as 
Harry fell down, down, down and — 

FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump Harry 
landed on something soft. Harry sat up and felt around, 
Harry eyes not used to the gloom. his eyes felt as though Harry 
was sitting on some sort of plant. 

“his eyes’s okay!” Harry called up to the light the size of a 
postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “his eyes’s a 
soft landing, you can jump!” 

Page | 310 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry followed right away. Harry landed, sprawled next to HarryHarry. 

“What’s this stuff?” were Harry first words. 

“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here 
to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!” 

The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark 
from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. Hermione 
landed on Harry’s other side. 

“We must be miles under the school,” Hermione said. 

“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Harry. 

“Lucky\” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!” 

Hermione leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. Hermione 
had to struggle because the moment Hermione had landed, 
the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils 
around Hermione ankles. As for Harry and Harry, Harry and Ron legs 
had already been bound tightly in long creepers 
without Harry and Ron noticing. 

Hermione had managed to free Hermione before the plant got a firm grip on Hermione. Now Hermione watched in 
horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off 
the two boys, but the more the two boys strained against the, the 
tighter and faster the plant wound around the two boys. 

“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered the two boys. “I know what 
this is — this’s Devil’s Snare!” 

“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s 
great help,” snarled Harry, leaning back, trying to stop 
the plant from curling around Harry neck. 



Page | 311 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said 
Hermione. 

“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, 
wrestling with it as it curled around Harry chest. 

“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare ... what did Professor 
Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp — ” 

“So light a fire!” Harry choked. 

“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermionecried, wringing Hermione hands. 

“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Harry bellowed. “ARE YOU A 
WITCH OR NOT?” 

“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and Hermione whipped out Hermione 
wand, waved her 
wand, muttered something, and sent a jet of 
the same bluebell flames Hermione had used on Snape at 
the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it 
loosening it grip as it cringed away from the light 
and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled it 
from Wriggling and flailing bodies, and Wriggling and flailing were able to pull free. 

“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” 
said Harry as Harry joined Hermione by the wall, wiping sweat 
off Harry face. 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “and Harry Harry doesn’t lose Harry 
head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” 

“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone 
passageway, which was the only way forward. 

All they could hear apart from they footsteps was the 
gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The 
passageway sloped downward, and Harry was 
reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the 

Page | 312 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




heart, Harry remembered the dragons said to be 
guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If the dragons met a 
dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad 
enough ... 

“Can you hear something?” Harry whispered. 

Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to 
be coming from up ahead. 

“Do you think it’s a ghost?” 

“I don’t know ... sounds like wings to Harry.” 

“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.” 

the dragons reached the end of The 
passageway and saw 
before the dragons a brilliantly lit chamber, a brilliantly lit chamber ceiling 
arching high above the dragons. a brilliantly lit chamber was full of small, jewel- 
bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the 
room. On the opposite side of a brilliantly lit chamber was a 
heavy wooden door. 

“Do you think the dragons’ll attack us if us cross the 
room?” 
said Harry. 

“Probably,” said Harry. “the dragons don’t look very vicious, 
but I suppose if the dragons swooped down at once . . . 
well, there’s no other choice ... I’ll run.” 

He took a deep breath, covered He face with He arms, 
and sprinted across the 
room. He expected to feel 
sharp beaks and claws tearing at He any second, 
but nothing happened. He reached a 
heavy wooden door. He pulled the handle, but the handle was locked. 

The other two followed He. They tugged and heaved 
at a 
heavy wooden door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when 
Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm. 

Page | 313 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Now what?” said Harry. 



“These birds ... These birds ... can’t be here just for decoration,” 
said Hermione. 

These birds ... watched These birds ... soaring overhead, glittering — 
glittering? 

“These birds ...’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “These birds ...’re 
keys\ Winged keys — look carefully. So that must 
mean ...” He looked around a brilliantly lit chamber while the 
other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes — 
look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the 
door!” 

“But there are hundreds of them!” 

Harry examined the lock on the 
door. 

“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably 
silver, like the handle.” 

They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the 
air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They 
grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted 
and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to 
catch one. 

Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest 
Seeker in a century. Harry the youngest 
Seeker had a knack for spotting 
things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving 
about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, Harry the youngest 
Seeker 
noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if he 
 
had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the 
keyhole. 

“That one!” Harry the youngest 
Seeker called to the others. “That big one — 
there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the 
feathers are all crumpled on one side.” 

Page | 314 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry went speeding in the direction that Harry was 
pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off 
Harry broom. 

“We’ve got to close in on his broom!” Harry called, not taking 
Harry eyes off a large silver key that had a bent wing with the damaged wing. “Harry, you 
come at his broom from above Hermione, stay below and 
stop his broom from going down — and I’ll try and catch his broom. 
Right, NOW!” 

Harry dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key 
dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped 
toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a 
nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone 
with one hand. Harry and Hermione ’s cheers echoed 
around a brilliantly lit chamber. 

Ron and Hermione ’s cheers landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the 
key struggling in one hand. Harry rammed the door into the lock 
and turned — the door worked. The moment the lock 
 had 
clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very 
battered now that the door had been caught twice. 

“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, Harry hand on the 
door handle. Ron and Hermione ’s cheers nodded. Harry pulled the door open. 

a brilliantly lit chamber was so dark Ron and Hermione ’s cheers couldn’t see 
anything at all. But as Ron and Hermione ’s cheers stepped into a brilliantly lit chamber, light 
suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing 
sight. 

Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, 
behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than 
Ron and Hermione ’s cheers were and carved from what looked like black 
stone. Facing Ron and Hermione ’s cheers, way across a brilliantly lit chamber, were 
the white pieces. Harry, Harry and Hermione shivered 
slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. 

“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. 

Page | 315 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s obvious, isn’t It?” said Harry. “We’ve got to play We 
way across the room.” 



Behind the white pieces the white pieces could see another door. 

“How?” said Hermione nervously. 

“I think,” said Harry, “We’re going to have to be 
chessmen.” 

Harry walked up to a black knight and put Harry hand out 
to touch the knights horse. At once, black 
stone sprang 
to life. the knights horse pawed the ground and a black knightturned a black knight helmeted head to look down at Harry. 

“Do We — er — have to join you to get across?” 

a black knight nodded. Harry turned to the other 
two. 

“This needs thinking about. ...” Harry said. “I suppose 
we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces. 



Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Harrythink. Finally Harry said, “Now, don’t be offended or 
anything, but neither of Harry are that good at chess — 



“we’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell we 
what to do.” 

“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and 
Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” 

“What about you?” 

“I’m going to be a knight,” said Harry. 

Page | 316 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because 
at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned 
a knight, a bishop, and a castle backs on the white pieces and walked off the 
board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Harry, 
and Hermione took. 

“White always plays first in chess,” said Harry, peering 
across the 
board. “Yes ... look ...” 

A white pawn had moved forward two squares. 

Harry started to direct the white pieces. the white pieces moved 
silently wherever Harry sent the white pieces. Harry’s knees were 
trembling. What if the white pieces lost? 

— of course move diagonally four squares to the right.” 

the white pieces first real shock came when the white pieces other knight 
was taken. The white queen smashed their other knight 
 to the floor 
and dragged their other knight 
 off the board, where their other knight 
 lay quite 
still, facedown. 

“Had to let that happen,” said Harry, looking shaken. 
“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go 
on.” 

Every time one of their men was lost, the white piecesshowed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp 
black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Harry only 
just noticed in time that Harry, Ron and Hermione were in 
danger. Harry darted around the 
board, taking 
almost as many white pieces as Harry, Ron and Hermione had lost black 
ones. 

“We’re nearly there,” Harry muttered suddenly. “Let me 
think — let me think ...” 

The white queen turned The white queen blank face toward Harry. 



Page | 317 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes ...” said Harry softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got 
to be taken.” 



“NO!” Harry, Ron and Hermione shouted. 

“That’s chess!” snapped Harry. “You’ve got to make 
some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me — 
that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” 

“But — of course“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” 

“Ron — ” 

“Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the 
Stone!” 

There was no alternative. 

“Ready?” Harry called, Harry face pale but determined. 
“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve 
won.” 

Harry stepped forward, and The white queen pounced. 
The white queen struck Harry hard across the head with The white queen stone 
arm, and Harry crashed to the floor 
 — Hermionescreamed but stayed on The white queen square — The white queen dragged Harry to one side. Harry looked as if Harry’d 
been knocked out. 

Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. 

The white king took off The white king crown and threw his crown at 
Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and 
bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last 
desperate look back at Harry, Harry and Hermionecharged through the door and up the next 
passageway. 

Page | 318 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“What if Harry’s — ?” 



“Harry’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince 
Harry. “What do you reckonhe’s next?” 

“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; 
Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall 
transfigured The chessmen to make them alive; that 
leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” 

them had reached another door. 

“All right?” Harry whispered. 

“Go on.” 

Harry pushed it open. 

A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of 
both of 
 pull both of 
 robes up over both of 
 noses. Eyes 
watering, both of 
 saw, flat on the floor 
 in front of both of 
, a 
troll even larger than the one both of 
 had tackled, out 
cold with a bloody lump on the one they had tackled head. 

“I“ glad both of 
 didn’t have to fight the one they had tackled,” Harrywhispered as they stepped carefully over one of its 
massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.” 

Harry pulled open another door, both of them hardly 
daring to look at what came next — but there was 
nothing very frightening in here, just a table with 
seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a 
line. 

“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do both of 
 have to do?” 

both of them hardly 
 stepped over the threshold, and immediately a 
fire sprang up behind both of them hardly 
 in the doorway. It wasn’t 
ordinary fire either; It was purple. At the same 

Page | 319 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




instant, black flames shot up in the doorway. black flames were trapped. 

“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to 
the bottles. Harry looked over Harry shoulder to read her shoulder: 

Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, 

Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, 

One among us seven will let you move ahead, 

Another will transport the drinker back instead, 

Two among us number hold only nettle wine, 

Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. 

Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, 

To help you in your choice, us give you these clues 
four: 

First, however slyly the poison tries to hide 

You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; 

Second, different are those who stand at either end, 

But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; 

Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, 

Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in dwarf nor giant insides; 

Fourth, the second left and the second on the right 

Are twins once you taste twins, though different at first 
sight 

Page | 320 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw 
that Hermione was smiling, the very last thing he felt like 
doing. 

“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s 
logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t 
got an ounce of logic, A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t 
’d be stuck in here forever.” 

“But so will we, won’t we?” 

“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need 
is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; 
two are wine; one will get we safely through the black 
fire, and one will get we back through the purple.” 

“But how do we know which to drink?” 

“Give me a minute.” 

Hermione read this paper several times. Then Hermione 
walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to 
Hermione and pointing at them. At last, Hermione clapped Hermione 
hands. 

“Got her 
hands,” Hermione said. “The smallest bottle will get The smallest bottlethrough the black fire — toward the 
Stone.” 

Harry looked at The smallest bottle. 

“There’s only enough there for one of us,” Harry said. 
“That’s hardly one swallow.” 

They looked at each other. 

“Which one will get you back through the purple 
flames?” 

Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end 
of the line. 

Page | 321 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and 
get Harry. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, 
they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — 
go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to 
Dumbledore, we need 
Dumbledore. I might be able to hold 
Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for 
Dumbledore, 
really.” 

“But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” 

“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, 
pointing at Harry scar. “I might get lucky again.” 

Hermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry. 

“Hermionel” 

“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” 

“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very 
embarrassed, as Hermione let go of Harry. 

“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There 
are more important things — friendship and bravery 
and — oh Harry — be carefull” 

“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is 
which, aren’t you?” 

“Positive,” said Hermione. Hermione took a long drink from 
the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. 

“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously. 

“No — but It’s like ice.” 

“Quick, go, before It wears off.” 



Page | 322 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Good luck — take care — ” 



“GO!” 

Hermione turned and walked straight through the 
purple fire. 

Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest 
bottle. Harry turned to face the black flames. 

“Here I come,” Harry said, and Harry drained the smallest 
bottlein one gulp. 

It was indeed as though ice was flooding Harry body. Harry 
put the smallest 
bottle down and walked forward; Harry braced 
Harry, saw the black flames licking his body, but 
couldn’t feel the black flames — for a moment Harry could see 
nothing but dark fire — then Harry was on the other 
side, in the last chamber. 

There was already someone there — but it wasn’t 
Snape. It wasn’t even Voldemort.

THE MAN WITH TWO FACES 

It was Quirrell. 

“You\” gasped Harry. 

Quirrell smiled. Quirrell face wasn’t twitching at all. 

“Me,” Quirrell said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be 
meeting you here, Potter.” 

“But I thought — Snape — ” 

“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and Quirrell wasn’t Quirrell usual 
quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, 
Severus does seem the type, doesn’t Severus? So useful to 
have Severus swooping around like an overgrown bat. 

Next to Severus, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- 
stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?Harry Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it 
couldn’t. 

“But Snape tried to kill me!” 

Page | 324 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



“No, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss 
Granger accidentally knocked me over as Your friend Miss 
Granger rushed 
to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. Your friend Miss 
Granger 
broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds 
and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed 
that broom before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a 
countercurse, trying to save you.” 

Snape Snape was trying to save me?” 

“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think 
Snape wanted to referee your next match? Snape was trying 
to make sure I didn’t do that broom again. Funny, really ... Snape 
needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with 
Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought 
Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, Snape 
did make Snape unpopular . . . and what a waste of 
time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.” 

Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin 
air and wrapped Ropes tightly around Harry. 

“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the 
school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d 
seen me coming to look at what was guarding the 
Stone.” 

“ You let the troll in?” 

“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must 
have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back 
there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was 
running around looking for everyone else was 
, Snape, who already 
suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head 
me off — and not only did the troll fail to beat you to 
death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to 
bite Snape ’s leg off properly. 



Page | 325 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this 
interesting mirror.” 

It was only then that Harry realized what was 
standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. 

“the Mirror of Erised is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrellmurmured, tapping Quirrell way around the frame. “Trust 
Dumbledore to come up with something like this . . . 
but Quirrell’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time Quirrell 
gets back. ...” 

Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrelltalking and stop Quirrell from concentrating on the Mirror of Erised. 

“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” Snape blurted out. 

“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the Mirror of Erised to 
look at the back. “Snape was on to me by that time, 
trying to find out how far I’d got. Snape suspected me all 
along. Tried to frighten me — as though Snape could, 
when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...” 

Quirrell came back out from behind the Mirror of Erised and 
stared hungrily into the Mirror of Erised. 

“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting the Stone to “Master ... 
but where is the Stone?” 

Harry struggled against the ropes binding Harry, but 
they didn’t give. Harry had to keep Quirrell from giving 
Harry whole attention to the Mirror of Erised. 

“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” 

“Oh, Snape does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. 
Snape was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you 



Page | 326 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




know? Page | 326 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




 loathed each other. But Snape never wanted 
you dead.” 

“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought 
Snape was threatening you. 

For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across 
Quirrell’s face. 

“Sometimes,” Snape said, “I find it hard to follow “Master’s instructions — Snape is a great wizard and I am 
weak — ” 

“You mean Snape was there in the classroom with you?” 
Harry gasped. 

“Snape is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I 
met Snape when I traveled around the world. A foolish 
young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about 
good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong 
I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, 
and those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have 
served Lord Voldemort faithfully, although I have let Lord Voldemort down 
many times. Lord Voldemort has had to be very hard on me.” 
Quirrell shivered suddenly. “Lord Voldemort does not forgive 
mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from 
Gringotts, Lord Voldemort was most displeased. Lord Voldemort punished me 
. . . decided Lord Voldemort would have to keep a closer watch on 
me. ...” 

Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering 
Harry trip to Diagon Alley — how could Harry have been so 
stupid? Harry’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken 
hands with Harry in the Leaky Cauldron. 

Quirrell cursed under Quirrell breath. 

“I don’t understand ... is the Stone? 
Should I break the mirror?” 

Page | 327 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry’s mind was racing. 



What I want more than anything else in the world at 
the moment, Harry thought, is to find the Stone before 
Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see 
my self finding the mirror — which means I’ll see where the mirror’s 
hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing 
what I’m up to? 

Harry tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass 
without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around Harry 
ankles were too tight: Harry tripped and fell over. Quirrellignored Harry. Harry was still talking to Harry. 

“What does the mirror do? How does the mirror work? Help 
me, “Master!” 

And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice 
seemed to come from Quirrell. 

“Use the boy ... Use the boy ...” 

Quirrell rounded on Harry. 

“Yes — Potter — come here.” 

— Potter — clapped — Potter — hands once, and the ropes around his 
ankles fell off. Harry got slowly to Harry feet. 

“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror 
and tell me what you see.” 

Harry walked toward Harry. 

I must lie, Harry thought desperately. I must look and lie 
about what I see, that’s all. 

Quirrell moved close behind Harry. Harry breathed in 
the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s

But a moment later, the reflection smiled at Page | 328 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




turban. the reflection 
put the reflection hand into the reflection pocket and pulled out a blood- 
red stone. the reflection winked and put the Stone back in the Stone 
pocket — and as the reflection did so, Harry felt something heavy 
drop into its pocket. Somehow — incredibly — 
Harry’d gotten the Stone. 

“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?” 
Harry screwed up Harry courage. 

“I see Harry shaking hands with Dumbledore,” Dumbledore 
invented. “I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” 

Quirrell cursed again. 

“Get out of the way,” Dumbledore said. As Harry moved aside, 
Dumbledore felt the Stone against Dumbledore leg. Dare Dumbledore 
make a break for it? 

But Dumbledore hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice 
spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving Dumbledore lips. 

“Dumbledore lies ... Dumbledore lies ...” 

Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me 
the truth! What did you just see?” 

a high voice 
 spoke again. 

“Let me speak to Dumbledore ... face-to-face. ...” 

“Master, you are not strong enough!” 

“I have strength enough ... for this. ...” 

Page | 329 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting Devil’s Snare to the 
spot. Devil’s Snare couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, Devil’s Snare 
watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap 
Devil’s Snare turban. What was going on? his turban fell away. 
Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without his turban. 

Then Devil’s Snare turned slowly on the 
spot. 

Harry would have screamed, but Harry couldn’t make a 
sound. Where there should have been a back to 
Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible 
face Harry had ever seen. face Harry was chalk white with 
glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. 

“Harry Potter ...” face Harry whispered. 

Harry tried to take a step backward but Harry legs 
wouldn’t move. 

“See what I have become?” a face, the most terrible 
face Harry had ever seen said. “Mere 
shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can 
share another’s body . . . but there have always been 
those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ... 
Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks 
. . . you saw Quirrell Quirrell drinking Quirrell for me in the 
forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be 
able to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don’t 
you give me that the Stone in your pocket?” 

So the Stone knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into 
Harry’s legs. the Stone stumbled backward. 

“Don’t be a fool,” snarled a face, the most terrible 
face Harry had ever seen. “Better save your 
own life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as 
your parents. ... 
your parents died begging me for mercy. ...” 

“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly. 



Page | 330 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Quirrell was walking backward at Harry, so that 
Voldemort could still see Harry. The evil face was now 
smiling. 

“How touching ...” The evil face hissed. “I always value bravery. 

... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your father first, and your father put up a courageous fight . . . but 
your mother needn’t have died ... your mother was trying to 
protect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you 
want your mother to have died in vain.” 

“NEVER!” 

Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort 
screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist. At once, a 
needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; Harry 
head felt as though it was about to split in two; Harry 
yelled, struggling with all Harry might, and to Harry 
surprise, Quirrell let go of Harry. The pain in Harry head 
lessened — Harry looked around wildly to see where 
Quirrell had gone, and saw Harry hunched in pain, 
looking at Harry fingers — they were blistering before Harry 
eyes. 

“Seize Harry! SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, 
and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, 
landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s 
neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with 
pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony. 

““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my 
hands!” 

And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground 
with Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, 
bewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry 
looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. 



Page | 331 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Then kill Harry, fool, and be done!” screeched 
Lord Voldemort. 

Quirrell raised Quirrell hand to perform a deadly curse, 
but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed 
Quirrell’s face — 

“AAAARGH!” 

Quirrell rolled off Quirrell, Quirrell face blistering, too, and 
then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch Harry bare 
skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only 
chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep his in 
enough pain to stop his from doing a curse. 

Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, 
and hung on as tight as Harry could. Quirrell screamed 
and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s 
head was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only 
hear Harry’s 
 terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells 
of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in 
Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!” 

Harry felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from Harry grasp, knew 
all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... 
down ... 

Something gold was glinting just above Harry. The 
Snitch! Harry tried to catch it, but Harry arms were too 
heavy. 

Harry blinked. It wasn’t The 
Snitch The 
Snitch at all. It was a pair of 
glasses. How strange. 

Harry blinked again. The smiling face of Albus 
Dumbledore swam into view above Albus 
Dumbledore swam. 

“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore. 



Page | 332 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry stared at Harry Potter. Then 332 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry remembered: “Sir! the Stone! It was Quirrell! 332 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry’s got the Stone! Sir, quick — 



“Calm yourself, Harry Potter, you are a little behind the 
times,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.” 

“Then who does? Sir, I — ” 

Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me 
thrown out.” 

Harry swallowed and looked around Harry. Harry realized 
Harry must be in the hospital wing. Harry was lying in a bed 
with white linen sheets, and next to Harry was a table 
piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. 

“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said 
Dumbledore, beaming. “What happened down in the 
dungeons between you and Quirrell is a 
complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school 
knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George 
Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a 
toilet seat. No doubt your friends Misters Fred and George 
Weasley thought it would amuse 
you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be 
very hygienic, and confiscated it.” 

“How long have I been in here?” 

“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger 
will be most relieved you have come round, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger 
 have 
been extremely worried.” 

“But sir, the Stone — ” 

“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Quirrell did not manage to take it 



Page | 333 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although 
you were doing very well on your own, I must say.” 

“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?” 

“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I 
reached London than it became clear to me that the 
place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived 
just in time to pull Quirrell off you — ” 

“It was you.” 

“I feared I might be too late.” 

“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept Quirrell off the Stone much longer — ” 

“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly 
killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid 
Not the Stone, boy had. As for the Stone, Not the Stone, boy has been destroyed.” 

“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — 
Nicolas Flamel — ” 

“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, 
sounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing 
properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a 
little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” 

“But that means Nicolas and Nicolas wife will die, won’t he and his wife?” 

“he and his wife have enough Elixir stored to set he and his wife affairs in 
order and then, yes, he and his wife will die.” 

Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on 
Harry’s face. 

“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, 
but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to 

Page | 334 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well- 
organized mind, death is but the next great 
adventure. You know, the Stone the Stone was really not such a 
wonderful thing. As much money and life as you 
could want! The two things most human beings would 
choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a 
knack of choosing precisely those things that are 
worst for humans.” 

Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed 
a little and smiled at the ceiling. 

Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if 
Harry’s 
 gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” 

“Call Sir Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper 
name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the 
thing itself.” 

“Yes, Sir. Well, Harry’s 
 going to try other ways of 
coming back, isn’t Harry’s 
? I mean, Harry’s 
 hasn’t gone, has 
Harry’s 
?” 

“No, Harry, Harry’s 
 has not. Harry’s 
 is still out there 
somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to 
share ... not being truly alive, Harry’s 
 cannot be killed. Harry’s 
 
left Quirrell to die; Harry’s 
 shows just as little mercy to Harry’s 
 
followers as Harry’s 
 enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while 
you may only have delayed Harry return to power, it will 
merely take someone else who is prepared to fight 
what seems a losing battle next time — and if Harry is 
delayed again, and again, why, Harry may never return 
to power.” 

Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made 
Harry head hurt. Then Harry said, Sir, there are some 
other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ... 
things I want to know the truth about. ...” 



Page | 335 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“the truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and 
terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with 
great caution. However, I shall answer your questions 
unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case 
I beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.” 

“Well ... Lord Voldemort said that Lord Voldemort only killed my mother 
because my mother 
 tried to stop Lord Voldemort from killing me. But 
why would Lord Voldemort want to kill me in the first place?” 

Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. 

“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. 

Not today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it 
from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . . 
I know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, 
you will know.” 

And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. 

“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?” 

“my mother 
 died to save you. If there is one thing 
Lord Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. Lord Voldemort didn’t 
realize that love as powerful as my mother 
’s for you 
leaves that love as powerful as your mother’s for you 
 own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to 
have been loved so deeply, even though the person 
who loved us is gone, will give us some protection 
forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, 
greed, and ambition, sharing Quirrell soul with Lord Voldemort, 
could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to 
touch a person marked by something so good.” 

Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out 
on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry Harry 
eyes on the sheet. When Harry had found Harry voice again, 
Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know 
who sent his voice to me?” 



Page | 336 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Ah — your father happened to leave his voice in my 
possession, and I thought you might like his voice.” 
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things ... Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens 
to steal food when Dumbledore was here.” 

“And there’s something else ...” 

“Fire away.” 

n’t Quirrell said Snape — ” 

“Professor Snape 
.” 

“Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell 
hated Dumbledore. Is that true?” 

“Well, Professor Snape 
 did rather detest each other. Not unlike 
yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, Dumbledore did 
something Snape could never forgive.” 

“What?” 

“Snape saved Snape life.” 

“What?” 

“Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way 
peopleHarry’s 
 minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape 
couldn’t bear being in DumbledoreHarry’s 
 debt. ... I do 
believe Professor Snape 
 worked so hard to protect you this year 
because Professor Snape 
 felt that would make Professor Snape 
 and your father 
even. Then Professor Snape 
 could go back to hating Dumbledore’s 
memory in peace. ...” 

Harry tried to understand this but this made Harry head 
pound, so Harry stopped. 

“And Sir, there’s one more thing ...” 

Page | 337 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Just the one?” 



“How did I get the Stone the Stone out of the mirror?” 

“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of 
my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, 
thatHarry’s 
 saying something. You see, only one who 
wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — 
would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see 
they making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My 
brain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough 
questions. I suggest you make a start on these 
sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was 
unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a 
vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve 
rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe 
with a nice toffee, don’t you?” 

Bertie Bott’s smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into the golden-brown beanmouth. Then Bertie Bott’s choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!” 

Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but 
very strict. 

“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded. 

“Absolutely not.” 

“You let Dumbledore Dumbledore in. ...” 

“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite 
different. You need rest.” 

“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go 
on, Madam Pomfrey ...” 

“Oh, very well,” Madam Pomfrey said. “But five minutes only.” 

And Madam Pomfrey let Ron and Hermione in. 

Page | 338 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Harryl” 



Hermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” 



 
again, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry 
head was still very sore. 

“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — 
Dumbledore was so worried — ” 

“The whole school’s talking about The whole school’s,” said Ron. “What 
really happened?” 

It was one of those rare occasions when the true story 
is even more strange and exciting than the wild 
rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the 
mirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort. Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the 
right places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was 
under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. 

“So Harry’s 
 gone?” said Ron finally. “Harry’s 
 just 
going to die?” 

“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — 
what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is 
but the next great adventure.’ ” 

“I always said Dumbledore was off Dumbledore rocker,” said Ron and Hermionelooking quite impressed at how crazy Dumbledore hero was. 

“So what happened to Ron and Hermione two?” said Harry. 

“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought 
Ron round — that took a while — and we were 
dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when 
we met Dumbledore in the entrance hall — Dumbledore already knew — 
Dumbledore just said, ‘Harry’s 
 gone after Harry, hasn’t Harry?’ and 
hurtled off to the third floor.” 

Page | 339 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“D’you think “D’you meant you to do “D’you?” said Ron. 
“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” 

“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if “D’you did — I mean to say 
— that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” 

“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. ““D’you’s a funny 
man, Dumbledore. I think “D’you sort of wanted to give 
me a chance. I think “D’you knows more or less 
everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon “D’you 
had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and 
instead of stopping we, “D’you just taught we enough to 
help. I don’t think it was an accident “D’you let me find 
out how the mirror worked. the mirror’s almost like “D’you thought 
I had the right to face Lord Voldemort if I could. ...” 

“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off Dumbledore rocker, all right,” said 
Ron. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end- 
of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and 
Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last 
Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by 
Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” 

At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. 

“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” Madam Pomfrey 
said firmly.

After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to 
normal. 

“I want to go to the end- 
of-year feast,” Harry told Madam Pomfrey as 
Madam Pomfrey straightened Harry many candy boxes. “I can, can’t 
I?”

“Dumbledore Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to 
go,” Madam Pomfrey said sniffily, as though in Madam Pomfrey opinion 
Dumbledore Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts 
could be. “And you have another visitor.” 

“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?” 

Hagrid sidled through the door as Dumbledore spoke. As usual 
when Dumbledore was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be 
allowed. Dumbledore sat down next to Harry, took one look at 
Dumbledore, and burst into tears. 

“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” Dumbledore sobbed, Dumbledore 
face in Dumbledore hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past 
Fluffy! I told Dumbledore! It was the only thing Dumbledore didn’t 
know, an’ I told Dumbledore! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a 
dragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked 
out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” 

Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking 
with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into 
Yeh beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, 
this is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, Yeh’d have found 
out even if you hadn’t told Yeh.” 

“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the 
name!” 

“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so 
shocked, Harry stopped crying. “I’ve met Harry and I’m 
calling Harry by Harry name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we 
saved the Stone, itHarry’s 
 gone, Harry can’t use it. Have a 
Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. ...” 

Hagrid wiped Hagrid nose on the back of Hagrid hand and 
said, “That reminds me. I’ve got Yeh a present.” 

“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is It?” said Harryanxiously, and at Hagrid Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.

“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter 
fix yesterday ter 
. ’Course, Dumbledore shoulda sacked me instead — 
anyway, got y eh this ...” 

this seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. 
Harry opened this curiously. this was full of wizard 
photographs. Smiling and waving at Harry from every 
page were Harry mother and father. 

“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, 
askin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh 
like it?” 

Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood. 

Harry made Harry way down to the end-of-year feast 
alone that night. Harry had been held up by Madam 
Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving Harry one 
last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. the Great Hall 
was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and 
silver to celebrate Madam 
Pomfrey’s winning the House Cup 
for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing 
the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the 
High Table. 

When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and 
then everybody started talking loudly at once. Harry 
slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the 
Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that 
people were standing up to look at Harry. 

Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The 
babble died away. 

“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. 

“And I must trouble you with an old manHarry’s 
 wheezing 
waffle before we sink we teeth into we delicious 
feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads 
are all a little fuller than your heads 
 were . . . you have the 
Page | 342 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty 
before next year starts. ... 

“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs 
awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, 
Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in 
third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; 

Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and 
Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” 

A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the 
Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging 
Harry goblet on the 
Slytherin table. It was a sickening sight. 

“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. 
“However, recent events must be taken into account.” 

The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded 
a little. 

“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute 
points to dish out. Let me see. Yes ... 

“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” 

Ron went purple in the face; Ron looked like a radish 
with a bad sunburn. 

"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has 
seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty 
points.” 

Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; 
the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be 
heard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you 
know! My brother! Got past McGonagall’s 
giant chess set!” 

At last there was silence again. 

Page | 343 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of 
cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House 
fifty points.” 

Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly 
suspected Hermione had burst into tears. Gryffindors up 
and down the table were beside Gryffindors up 
and down the table — Gryffindors up 
and down the table 
were a hundred points up. 

“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore. 

The room went deadly quiet. "... for pure nerve and 
outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty 
points.” 

The din was deafening. Those who could add up while 
yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now 
had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly 
the same as Slytherin. Those who could add up while 
yelling themselves had tied for the House 
Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one 
more point. 

Dumbledore raised Dumbledore hand. The room gradually fell 
silent. 

“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, 
smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up 
to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our 
friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville 
Longbottom.” 

Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well 
have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, 
so loud was the noise that erupted from the 
Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up 
to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, 
disappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville. Neville 
had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor 
before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs 
and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more 
Page | 344 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind 
Curse put on Harry Potter. 

“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of 
applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were 
celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little 
change of decoration.” 

He clapped He . In an instant, the green 
hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; 
the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering 
Gryffindor lion took the huge Slytherin serpent place. Snape was shaking 
Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced 
smile. Snape caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once 
that Snape ’s feelings toward Snape hadn’t changed one 
jot. This didn’t worry Harry. This seemed as though life 
would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it 
ever was at Hogwarts. 

It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than 
winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out 
mountain trolls ... Harry would never, ever forget tonight. 

Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results 
were still to come, but come the exam results 
were still to come did. To the exam results 
were still to come great 
surprise, both Harry and Ron passed with good marks; 
Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first 
years. Even Neville scraped through, Even Neville good 
Herbology mark making up for Even Neville abysmal Potions 
one. both he and Ron had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as 
stupid as Even Neville was mean, might be thrown out, but Even Neville 
had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you 
couldn’t have everything in life. 

And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their 
trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking 
in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all 
students, warning all 
students not to use magic over the 
holidays (“I always hope all 
students’ll forget to give us 
Page | 345 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to 
take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across 
the lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; 
talking and laughing as the countryside became 
greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor 
Beans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off 
them wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; 
pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at 
King’s Cross station. 

It took quite a while for them all to get off the 
platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket 
barrier, letting A wizened old guard go through the gate in twos and 
threes so A wizened old guard didn’t attract attention by all bursting 
out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. 

“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, 
“both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” 

“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look 
forward to.” 

People jostled People as People moved forward toward the 
gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of People 
called: 

“Bye, Harry!” 

“See you, Harry Potter!” 

“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at Ron. 

“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. 

He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway 
together. 

“There He, Ron, and Hermione is, Mom, there He, Ron, and Hermione is, look!” 



Page | 346 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she 
wasn’t pointing at Ron. 

“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see 
“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” 

Fred Weasley smiled down at them. 

“Busy year?” she said. 

“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the 
sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” 

“Oh, it was nothing, dear.” 

“Ready, are you?” 

It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still 
mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, 
carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary 
people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, 
looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. 

“You must be Harry’s family!” said Fred Weasley. 

“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry 
up, boy, we haven’t got all day.” him walked away. 

Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and 
Hermione. 

“See you over the summer, then.” 

“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said 
Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, 
shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.

“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at 
the grin that was spreading over Harry face. “ they don’t 
know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m 
going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...”
