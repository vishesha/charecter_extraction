              "'Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, \\r\\nwere proud to say that Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four were perfectly normal, \\r\\nthank you very much. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four were the last people you’d \\r\\nexpect to be involved in anything strange or \\r\\nmysterious, because Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four just didn’t hold with such \\r\\nnonsense. \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called \\r\\nGrunnings, which made drills. Mr. Dursley was a big, beefy \\r\\nman with hardly any neck, although Mr. Dursley did have a \\r\\nvery large mustache. Mr. Dursley was thin and \\r\\nblonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of \\r\\nneck, which came in very useful as Mr. Dursley spent so \\r\\nmuch of Mr. Dursley time craning over garden fences, spying \\r\\non the neighbors. Mr. Dursley had a small son \\r\\ncalled Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \\r\\nboy anywhere. \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley had everything Mr. Dursley wanted, but Mr. Dursley \\r\\nalso had a secret, and Mr. Dursley greatest fear was that \\r\\nsomebody would discover \\r\\n. Mr. Dursley didn’t think Mr. Dursley \\r\\ncould bear \\r\\n if anyone found out about the Potters. \\r\\nMr. Dursley was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but Mr. Dursley hadn’t \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 2 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmet for several years; in fact, Mr. Dursley pretended \\r\\nMr. Dursley didn’t have a sister, because Mr. Dursley sister and Mr. Dursley \\r\\ngood-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it \\r\\nwas possible to be. Mr. Dursley shuddered to think \\r\\nwhat the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in \\r\\nthe street. Mr. Dursley knew that the Potters had a \\r\\nsmall son, too, but the Potters had a \\r\\nsmall son, too had never even seen a \\r\\nsmall son. \\r\\n\\r\\na \\r\\nsmall son was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; the Potters didn’t want Dudley mixing with a \\r\\nchild like that. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray \\r\\nTuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the \\r\\ncloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and \\r\\nmysterious things would soon be happening all over \\r\\nthe country. Mr. Dursley hummed as Mr. Dursley picked out \\r\\nMr. Dursley most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley \\r\\ngossiped away happily as Mrs. Dursley \\r\\n wrestled a screaming \\r\\nDudley into Mr. Dursley high chair. \\r\\n\\r\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past \\r\\nthe window. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up Mr. Dursleybriefcase, pecked Mr. Dursley on the cheek, and \\r\\ntried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because \\r\\nDudley was now having a tantrum and throwing Dudley \\r\\ncereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursleyas Mr. Dursley left the house. Mr. Dursley got into Mr. Dursley car and backed \\r\\nout of number four’s drive. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on the corner of the street that Mr. Dursley noticed the \\r\\nfirst sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a \\r\\nmap. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what Mr. Dursleyhad seen — then Mr. Dursley jerked Mr. Dursley head around to look \\r\\nagain. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \\r\\nof Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What \\r\\ncould Mr. Dursley have been thinking of? It must have been a \\r\\ntrick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at \\r\\nPage | 3 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around \\r\\nthe corner and up the road, Mr. Dursley watched a tabby cat standing on the corner \\r\\nof Privet Drive in Mr. Dursley \\r\\nmirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet \\r\\nDrive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read \\r\\nmaps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave Mr. Dursley a little shake \\r\\nand put a tabby cat standing on the corner \\r\\nof Privet Drive out of Mr. Dursley mind. As Mr. Dursley drove toward \\r\\ntown Mr. Dursley thought of nothing except a large order of \\r\\ndrills Mr. Dursley was hoping to get that day. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of Mr. Dursley \\r\\nmind by something else. As Mr. Dursley sat in the usual \\r\\nmorning traffic jam, Mr. Dursley couldn’t help noticing that \\r\\nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people \\r\\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear \\r\\npeople who dressed in funny clothes — the getups \\r\\nyou saw on young people! Mr. Dursley supposed this was some \\r\\nstupid new fashion. Mr. Dursley drummed Mr. Dursley fingers on the \\r\\nsteering wheel and Mr. Dursley eyes fell on a huddle of these \\r\\nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering \\r\\nexcitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see \\r\\nthat a couple of They weren’t young at all; why, that \\r\\nman had to be older than man was, and wearing an \\r\\nemerald-green cloak! The nerve of man! But then The nerve of him \\r\\nstruck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly \\r\\nstunt — these people were obviously collecting for \\r\\nsomething ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved \\r\\non and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the \\r\\nGrunnings parking lot, Mr. Dursley mind back on drills. \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley always sat with Mr. Dursley back to the window in \\r\\nMr. Dursley office on the ninth floor. If Mr. Dursley hadn’t, Mr. Dursley might \\r\\nhave found it harder to concentrate on drills that \\r\\nmorning. Mr. Dursley didn’t see the owls swooping past in \\r\\nbroad daylight, though people down in the street did; \\r\\npeople pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after \\r\\nowl sped overhead. Most of people had never seen an \\r\\nowl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a \\r\\nperfectly normal, owl-free morning. Mr. Dursley yelled at five \\r\\ndifferent people. Mr. Dursley made several important telephone \\r\\nPage | 4 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncalls and shouted a bit more. Mr. Dursley was in a very good \\r\\nmood until lunchtime, when Mr. Dursley thought Mr. Dursley’d stretch \\r\\nMr. Dursley legs and walk across the road to buy Mr. Dursley a \\r\\nbun from the bakery. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe’d forgotten all about five \\r\\ndifferent people until Mr. Dursley \\r\\npassed a group of five \\r\\ndifferent people next to the baker’s. Mr. Dursley eyed \\r\\nfive \\r\\ndifferent people angrily as Mr. Dursley passed. Mr. Dursley didn’t know why, but \\r\\nfive \\r\\ndifferent people made Mr. Dursley uneasy. This bunch were whispering \\r\\nexcitedly, too, and Mr. Dursley couldn’t see a single collecting \\r\\ntin. It was on Mr. Dursley way back past five \\r\\ndifferent people, clutching a \\r\\nlarge doughnut in a bag, that Mr. Dursley caught a few words \\r\\nof what five \\r\\ndifferent people were saying. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“ — yes, five \\r\\ndifferent people son, Harry — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded Mr. Dursley. Mr. Dursley \\r\\nlooked back at the whisperers as if Mr. Dursley wanted to say \\r\\nsomething to them, but thought better of the whisperers. \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley dashed back across the road, hurried up to Mr. Dursley \\r\\noffice, snapped at Mr. Dursley secretary not to disturb Mr. Dursley, \\r\\nseized Mr. Dursley telephone, and had almost finished dialing \\r\\nMr. Dursley home number when Mr. Dursley changed Mr. Dursley mind. Mr. Dursley put \\r\\nthe receiver back down and stroked Mr. Dursley mustache, \\r\\nthinking ... no, Mr. Dursley was being stupid. Potter wasn’t \\r\\nsuch an unusual name. Potter was sure there were lots \\r\\nof people called Potter who had a son called Harry. \\r\\nCome to think of it, Potter wasn’t even sure Potter nephew \\r\\nwas called Harry. Potter’d never even seen the boy. It \\r\\nmight have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no \\r\\npoint in worrying Mrs. Dursley; Mrs. Dursley always got so \\r\\nupset at any mention of Mrs. Dursley sister. Potter didn’t blame \\r\\nMrs. Dursley — if Potter’d had a sister like that ... but all the \\r\\nsame, those people in cloaks ... \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 5 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotter found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that \\r\\nafternoon and when Potter left the building at five o’clock, \\r\\nPotter was still so worried that Potter walked straight into \\r\\nsomeone just outside the door. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry,” someone just outside the door. \\r\\n\\r\\n grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled \\r\\nand almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the tiny old man was wearing a violet \\r\\ncloak. the tiny old man didn’t seem at all upset at being almost \\r\\nknocked to the ground. On the contrary, the tiny old man face split \\r\\ninto a wide smile and the tiny old man said in a squeaky voice that \\r\\nmade passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, \\r\\nfor nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- \\r\\nKnow-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like \\r\\nyourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy \\r\\nday!” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the tiny old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the \\r\\nmiddle and walked off. \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. Mr. Dursley had been \\r\\nhugged by a complete stranger. Mr. Dursley also thought Mr. Dursley \\r\\nhad been called a Muggle, whatever that was. Mr. Dursley was \\r\\nrattled. Mr. Dursley hurried to his car and set off for home, \\r\\nhoping Mr. Dursley was imagining things, which Mr. Dursley had never \\r\\nhoped before, because Mr. Dursley didn’t approve of \\r\\nimagination. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mr. Dursley pulled into the driveway of number four, the \\r\\nfirst thing Mr. Dursley saw — and it didn’t improve Mr. Dursley mood — \\r\\nwas the tabby cat Mr. Dursley’d spotted that morning. the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning was \\r\\nnow sitting on Mr. Dursley garden wall. Mr. Dursley was sure the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning was the \\r\\nsame one; the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning had the same markings around the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning eyes. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe tabby cat he’d spotted that morning didn’t move. the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning just gave Mr. Dursley a stern look. \\r\\n\\r\\nWas this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. \\r\\nTrying to pull Mr. Dursley together, Mr. Dursley let Mr. Dursley into the \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 6 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nhouse. Mr. Dursley was still determined not to mention \\r\\nanything to Mr. Dursley wife. \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. Mr. Dursley told \\r\\nMr. Dursley over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems \\r\\nwith Mr. Dursley daughter and how Dudley had learned a new \\r\\nword (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. \\r\\nWhen Dudley had been put to bed, Dudley went into the \\r\\nliving room in time to catch the last report on the \\r\\nevening news: \\r\\n\\r\\n“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported \\r\\nthat the nation’s owls have been behaving very \\r\\nunusually today. Although owls normally hunt at \\r\\nnight and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have \\r\\nbeen hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in \\r\\nevery direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to \\r\\nexplain why the nation’s owls have suddenly changed the nation’s owls \\r\\nsleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed The newscaster a \\r\\ngrin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim \\r\\nMcGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more \\r\\nshowers of owls tonight, Jim \\r\\n?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about \\r\\nthat, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting \\r\\noddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, \\r\\nand Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that \\r\\ninstead of the rain I promised yesterday, Kent, Yorkshire, \\r\\nand Dundee’ve had a \\r\\ndownpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have \\r\\nbeen celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until \\r\\nnext week, folks! But I can promise a wet night \\r\\ntonight.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in Mr. Dursley armchair. Shooting stars \\r\\nall over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious \\r\\npeople in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a \\r\\nwhisper about the Potters . . . \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 7 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley came into the living room carrying two \\r\\ncups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say \\r\\nsomething to Mr. Dursley. Mr. Dursley cleared Mr. Dursley throat nervously. “Er \\r\\n— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister \\r\\nlately, have you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mr. Dursley had expected, Mr. Dursley looked shocked and \\r\\nangry. After all, they normally pretended Mr. Dursley didn’t \\r\\nhave a sister. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” Mr. Dursley said sharply. “Why?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. \\r\\n“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of \\r\\nfunny-looking people in town today ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“So?” snapped Mr. Dursley. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to \\r\\ndo with ... you know ... Mr. Dursley crowd.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley sipped Mr. Dursley tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether Mr. Dursley dared tell Mr. Dursley Mr. Dursley’d \\r\\nheard “Harry.” Mr. Dursley decided Mr. Dursley didn’t dare. \\r\\nInstead Mr. Dursley said, as casually as Mr. Dursley could, “Owls son — \\r\\nMr. Dursley’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t Mr. Dursley?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose so,” said Mr. Dursley stiffly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s Howard again? Howard, isn’t “Harry?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking \\r\\nhorribly. “Yes, I quite agree.” \\r\\n\\r\\nhis didn’t say another word on the subject as they \\r\\nwent upstairs to bed. While Mr. Dursley was in the \\r\\nbathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 8 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nand peered down into the front garden. The cat was \\r\\nstill there. The cat was staring down Privet Drive as though \\r\\nThe cat were waiting for something. \\r\\n\\r\\nWas Mr. Dursley imagining things? Could all this have \\r\\nanything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out \\r\\nthat they were related to a pair of — well, Mr. Dursley didn’t \\r\\nthink Mr. Dursley could bear it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mr. Dursley fell asleep \\r\\nquickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over \\r\\nin Mr. Dursley mind. Mr. Dursley last, comforting thought before Mr. Dursley fell \\r\\nasleep was that even if the Potters were involved, \\r\\nthere was no reason for even if the Potters were involved to come near Mr. Dursley and \\r\\nMr. Dursley. the Potters knew very well what Mr. Dursley and \\r\\nPetunia thought about even if the Potters were involved and even if the Potters were involved kind. ... Mr. Dursley \\r\\ncouldn’t see how Mr. Dursley and Petunia could get mixed up \\r\\nin anything that might be going on — Mr. Dursley yawned and \\r\\nturned over — it couldn’t affect he and Petunia. ... \\r\\n\\r\\nHow very wrong Mr. Dursley was. \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy \\r\\nsleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no \\r\\nsign of sleepiness. the cat on the wall outside was sitting as still as a statue, \\r\\nthe cat on the wall outside eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet \\r\\nDrive. the cat on the wall outside didn’t so much as quiver when a car door \\r\\nslammed on the next street, nor when two owls \\r\\nswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight \\r\\nbefore the cat on the wall outside moved at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nA man appeared on the corner the cat on the wall outside had been \\r\\nwatching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d \\r\\nhave thought A man’d just popped out of the ground. the cat on the wall outside’s tail twitched and the cat on the wall outside eyes narrowed. \\r\\n\\r\\nNothing like A man had ever been seen on Privet \\r\\nDrive. A man was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the \\r\\nsilver of A man hair and beard, which were both long \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 9 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nenough to tuck into A man belt. A man was wearing long \\r\\nrobes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and \\r\\nhigh-heeled, buckled boots. A man blue eyes were light, \\r\\nbright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles \\r\\nand A man nose was very long and crooked, as though it \\r\\nhad been broken at least twice. A man’s name was \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that Albus Dumbledore had \\r\\njust arrived in a street where everything from Albus Dumbledore \\r\\nname to Albus Dumbledore boots was unwelcome. Albus Dumbledore was busy \\r\\nrummaging in Albus Dumbledore cloak, looking for something. But \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore did seem to realize Albus Dumbledore was being watched, because \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still \\r\\nstaring at Albus Dumbledore from the other end of the street. For \\r\\nsome reason, the sight of the cat on the wall outside seemed to amuse \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore chuckled and muttered, “I should have \\r\\nknown.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore found what Albus Dumbledore was looking for in Albus Dumbledore inside \\r\\npocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. Albus Dumbledore \\r\\nflicked It open, held It up in the air, and clicked It. \\r\\nThe nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. Albus Dumbledore \\r\\nclicked The nearest street lamp again — the next lamp flickered into \\r\\ndarkness. Twelve times Albus Dumbledore clicked the Put-Outer, \\r\\nuntil the only lights left on the whole street were two \\r\\ntiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of \\r\\nthe cat watching Albus Dumbledore. If anyone looked out of anyone \\r\\nwindow now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, anyone \\r\\nwouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening \\r\\ndown on the pavement. Albus Dumbledore slipped the Put- \\r\\nOuter back inside his cloak and set off down the \\r\\nstreet toward number four, where Albus Dumbledore sat down on the \\r\\nwall next to the cat on the wall outside. Albus Dumbledore didn’t look at the cat on the wall outside, but after a \\r\\nmoment Albus Dumbledore spoke to the cat on the wall outside. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 10 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore turned to smile at the tabby, but the tabby had gone. \\r\\nInstead Albus Dumbledore was smiling at a rather severe-looking \\r\\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \\r\\nshape of the markings the cat on the wall outside had had around the cat on the wall outside \\r\\neyes. a rather severe-looking \\r\\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \\r\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its \\r\\neyes, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. \\r\\na rather severe-looking \\r\\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \\r\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its \\r\\neyes black hair was drawn into a tight bun. Her black hairlooked distinctly ruffled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you know it was me?” a rather severe-looking \\r\\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \\r\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its \\r\\neyes asked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all \\r\\nday,” said Professor McGonagall. \\r\\n\\r\\n“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I \\r\\nmust have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my \\r\\nway here.” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” a rather severe-looking \\r\\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \\r\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its \\r\\neyes said \\r\\nimpatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, \\r\\nbut no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s \\r\\ngoing on. It was on they news.” a rather severe-looking \\r\\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \\r\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its \\r\\neyes jerked a rather severe-looking \\r\\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \\r\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its \\r\\neyes head \\r\\nback at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I \\r\\nheard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, \\r\\nFlocks of owls ... shooting stars’re not completely stupid. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars were bound to \\r\\nnotice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll \\r\\nbet that was Dedalus Diggle. Kent — I’ll \\r\\nbet that was Dedalus Diggle never had much \\r\\nsense.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t blame them,” said Albus Dumbledore gently. \\r\\n“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven \\r\\nyears.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are \\r\\nbeing downright careless, out on the streets in broad \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 11 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ndaylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, \\r\\nswapping rumors.” \\r\\n\\r\\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Albus Dumbledore \\r\\nhere, as though hoping Albus Dumbledore was going to tell She \\r\\nsomething, but Albus Dumbledore didn’t, so She went on. “A fine \\r\\nthing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who \\r\\nseems to have disappeared at last, even the Muggles found \\r\\nout about us all. I suppose Albus Dumbledore really has gone, \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It certainly seems so,” said Albus Dumbledore. “We have \\r\\nmuch to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon \\r\\ndrop?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“A what?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“A lemon drop. We’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m \\r\\nrather fond of.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as \\r\\nthough Professor McGonagall didn’t think this was the moment for \\r\\nlemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has \\r\\ngone — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like \\r\\nyourself can call a sensible person like \\r\\nyourself by a sensible person like \\r\\nyourself name? All this You- \\r\\nKnow-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been \\r\\ntrying to persuade people to call a sensible person like \\r\\nyourself by a sensible person like \\r\\nyourself proper \\r\\nname: Voldemort \\r\\n.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but \\r\\nDumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, \\r\\nseemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we \\r\\nkeep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any \\r\\nreason to be frightened of saying Voldemort \\r\\n’s name.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, \\r\\nsounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re \\r\\ndifferent. Everyone knows you’re the only one You- \\r\\nKnow- oh, all right, Voldemort \\r\\n, was frightened of.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 12 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You flatter me,” said Albus Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort \\r\\n \\r\\nhad powers I will never have.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use \\r\\nOnly because you’re too.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s lucky It’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since \\r\\nMadam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to \\r\\nthe rumors that are flying around. You know what \\r\\neveryone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? \\r\\n\\r\\nAbout what finally stopped he?” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the \\r\\npoint Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real \\r\\nreason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all \\r\\nday, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman \\r\\nfixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall \\r\\ndid now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was \\r\\nsaying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true. Albus Dumbledore, \\r\\nhowever, was choosing another lemon drop and did \\r\\nnot answer. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What they’re saying,” Professor McGonagall pressed on, “is that last \\r\\nnight Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. last \\r\\nnight Voldemort \\r\\nwent to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and \\r\\nJames Potter are — are — that Lily and \\r\\nJames Potter are —’re — dead.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head. Professor McGonagall \\r\\ngasped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to \\r\\nbelieve it ... Oh, Albus ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore reached out and patted Albus Dumbledore on the \\r\\nshoulder. “I know ... I know ...” Albus Dumbledore said heavily. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went \\r\\non. “it’s dark. 13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice’re saying Albus Dumbledore tried to kill the \\r\\nPotters’ son, Harry. But — Albus Dumbledore couldn’t. Albus Dumbledore couldn’t \\r\\nkill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but \\r\\n13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice’re saying that when Albus Dumbledore couldn’t kill Harry Potter, \\r\\nVoldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore’s gone.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore nodded glumly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s — It’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After \\r\\nall Albus Dumbledore’s done ... all the people Albus Dumbledore’s killed ... Albus Dumbledore couldn’t \\r\\nkill a little boy? It’s just astounding ... of all the \\r\\nthings to stop Albus Dumbledore . . . but how in the name of heaven \\r\\ndid Harry survive?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“We can only guess,” said Albus Dumbledore. “We may \\r\\nnever know.” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief \\r\\nand dabbed at Professor McGonagall eyes beneath Professor McGonagall spectacles. \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore gave a great sniff as Albus Dumbledore took a golden \\r\\nwatch from Albus Dumbledore pocket and examined a golden \\r\\nwatch from his pocket. It was a very \\r\\nodd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; \\r\\ninstead, little planets were moving around the edge. It \\r\\nmust have made sense to Albus Dumbledore, though, \\r\\nbecause Albus Dumbledore put It back in his pocket and said, \\r\\n“Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I’d be \\r\\nhere, by the way?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t \\r\\nsuppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all \\r\\nplaces?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve come to bring Harry to Harry aunt and uncle. \\r\\n“’re the only family Harry has left now.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who \\r\\nlive here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to Professor McGonagall \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 14 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfeet and pointing at number four. “Albus Dumbledore — you \\r\\ncan’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t \\r\\nfind two people who are less like us. And two people who are less like us’ve got \\r\\nthis son — I saw this son kicking this son mother all the way \\r\\nup the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter \\r\\ncome and live here!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the best place for him,” said Albus Dumbledore firmly. \\r\\n“his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything \\r\\nto Albus Dumbledore when Albus Dumbledore’s older. I’ve written his aunt and uncle a letter.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, \\r\\nsitting back down on the \\r\\nwall. “Really, Albus Dumbledore, \\r\\nyou think you can explain all this in a letter? These \\r\\npeople will never understand Albus Dumbledore! Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — \\r\\na legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was \\r\\nknown as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will \\r\\nbe books written about Harry — every child in our \\r\\nworld will know every child in our \\r\\nworld name!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously \\r\\nover the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be \\r\\nenough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can \\r\\nwalk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even \\r\\nremember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, \\r\\ngrowing up away from all that until he’s ready to take \\r\\nit?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall opened Professor McGonagall mouth, changed Professor McGonagall \\r\\nmind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re \\r\\nright, of course. But how is the boy getting here, \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall eyed Albus Dumbledore cloak suddenly as though \\r\\nProfessor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hagrid’s bringing Albus Dumbledore.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with \\r\\nsomething as important as this?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 15 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Albus Dumbledore. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not saying the boy heart isn’t in the right place,” said \\r\\nProfessor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t \\r\\npretend the boy’s not careless. the boy does tend to — what \\r\\nwas that?” \\r\\n\\r\\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around \\r\\nthem. It grew steadily louder as them looked up and \\r\\ndown the street for some sign of a headlight; It \\r\\nswelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — \\r\\nand a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed \\r\\non the road in front of them. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf a huge motorcycle was huge, a huge motorcycle was nothing to the man \\r\\nsitting astride a huge motorcycle. the man \\r\\n was almost twice as tall as a \\r\\nnormal man and at least five times as wide. the man \\r\\n looked \\r\\nsimply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long \\r\\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of the man \\r\\n \\r\\nface, the man \\r\\n had hands the size of trash can lids, and the man \\r\\n \\r\\nfeet in — long \\r\\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard leather boots were like baby dolphins. In \\r\\nhis vast, muscular arms his was holding a bundle of \\r\\nblankets. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hagrid,” said Albus Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At \\r\\nlast. And where did you get a huge motorcycle?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Borrowed a huge motorcycle, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said a huge motorcycle, climbing carefully off a huge motorcycle as he \\r\\nspoke. “Young Sirius Black lent a huge motorcycle to me. I’ve got Young Sirius Black, \\r\\nsir.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No problems, were there?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got sir — houseout all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ \\r\\naround. Young Sirius Black fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 16 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward \\r\\nover the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a \\r\\nbaby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair \\r\\nover his forehead they could see a curiously shaped \\r\\ncut, like a bolt of lightning. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Albus Dumbledore. “Hell have that scar forever.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Couldn’t you do something about it, Albus Dumbledore?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect \\r\\nmap of the London Underground. Well — give him \\r\\nhere, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned \\r\\ntoward the Dursleys’ house. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked \\r\\nHagrid. sir bent sir great, shaggy head over Harryand gave sir what must have been a very scratchy, \\r\\nwhiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl \\r\\nlike a wounded dog. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the \\r\\nMuggles!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted \\r\\nhandkerchief and burying sir face in Hagrid. “But I c-c- \\r\\ncan’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little \\r\\nHarry live with Muggles — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, \\r\\nHagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and \\r\\nwalked to the front door. Albus Dumbledore laid Harry gently on the \\r\\nPage | 17 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ndoorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked a letterinside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the \\r\\nother two. For a full minute the three of the \\r\\nother two stood \\r\\nand looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders \\r\\nshook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and \\r\\nthe twinkling light that usually shone from \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said Albus Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no \\r\\nbusiness staying here. We may as well go and join the \\r\\ncelebrations.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best \\r\\nget this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall — \\r\\nProfessor Dumbledore, sir.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWiping Professor McGonagall — \\r\\nProfessor Dumbledore, sir.” \\r\\n\\r\\n streaming eyes on Professor McGonagall — \\r\\nProfessor Dumbledore, sir.” \\r\\n\\r\\n jacket sleeve, Hagridswung Professor McGonagall — \\r\\nProfessor Dumbledore, sir.” \\r\\n\\r\\n onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the \\r\\nengine into life; with a roar the \\r\\nengine rose into the air and off \\r\\ninto the night. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” \\r\\nsaid Albus Dumbledore, nodding to Professor McGonagall. Professor McGonagall blew Professor McGonagall nose in reply. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. \\r\\nOn the corner Albus Dumbledore stopped and took out the silver Put- \\r\\nOuter. Albus Dumbledore clicked the silver Put- \\r\\nOuter once, and twelve balls of light \\r\\nsped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive \\r\\nglowed suddenly orange and Albus Dumbledore could make out a \\r\\ntabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end \\r\\nof the street. Albus Dumbledore could just see the bundle of blankets \\r\\non the step of number four. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good luck, Harry,” Albus Dumbledore murmured. Albus Dumbledore turned on Albus Dumbledore \\r\\nheel and with a swish of his cloak, Albus Dumbledore was gone. \\r\\n\\r\\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which \\r\\nlay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 18 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nplace you would expect astonishing things to happen. \\r\\nHarry Potter rolled over inside Harry Potter blankets without \\r\\nwaking up. One small hand closed on a letterbeside Harry Potter and Harry Potter slept on, not knowing Harry Potter was \\r\\nspecial, not knowing Harry Potter was famous, not knowing Harry Potter \\r\\nwould be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. \\r\\n\\r\\nDursley’s scream as Mrs. \\r\\n\\r\\nDursley opened the front door to put \\r\\nout the milk bottles, nor that Harry Potter would spend the next \\r\\nfew weeks being prodded and pinched by Harry Potter cousin \\r\\nDudley. ... Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very \\r\\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country \\r\\nwere holding up people glasses and saying in hushed \\r\\nvoices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 19 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VANASHIG GLASS \\r\\n\\r\\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had \\r\\nwoken up to find their nephew on the front step, but \\r\\nPrivet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose \\r\\non the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass \\r\\nnumber four on the Dursleys’ front door; The sun crept into \\r\\ntheir living room, which was almost exactly the same \\r\\nas The sun had been on the night when Mrs. \\r\\n\\r\\nDursley had \\r\\nseen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the \\r\\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how \\r\\nmuch time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been \\r\\nlots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach \\r\\nball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Mrs. \\r\\n\\r\\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now Only the \\r\\nphotographs on the mantelpiece showed a large blond boy riding a large blond boy first \\r\\nbicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer \\r\\ngame with a large blond boy father, being hugged and kissed by a large blond boymother. \\r\\ntheir living room, which was almost exactly the same \\r\\nas it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had \\r\\nseen that fateful news report about the owls held no sign at a large blond boylived in the house, too. \\r\\n\\r\\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, \\r\\nbut not for long. Harry Potter Aunt Petunia was awake and His Aunt Petunia \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 20 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwas His Aunt Petunia shrill voice that made the first noise of the \\r\\nday. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Up! Get up! Now!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry woke with a start. His Aunt Petunia rapped on the door \\r\\nagain. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Up!” His Aunt Petunia screeched. Harry heard His Aunt Petunia walking toward \\r\\nthe kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan \\r\\nbeing put on the stove. Harry rolled onto Harry back and \\r\\ntried to remember the dream Harry had been having. It \\r\\nhad been a good one. There had been a flying \\r\\nmotorcycle in it. Harry had a funny feeling Harry’d had the \\r\\nsame dream before. \\r\\n\\r\\nHis Aunt Petunia was back outside the door \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you up yet?” His Aunt Petunia demanded. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nearly,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the \\r\\nbacon. And don’t you dare let the \\r\\nbacon burn, I want \\r\\neverything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry groaned. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you say?” His Aunt Petunia snapped through the door \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, nothing ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley’s birthday — how could ” \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley’s birthday have forgotten? \\r\\nHarry got slowly out of bed and started looking for \\r\\nsocks. Harry found a pair under Harry bed and, after \\r\\npulling a spider off one of a pair, put a pair on. Harrywas used to spiders, because the cupboard under the \\r\\nstairs was full of a pair, and that was where Harry slept. \\r\\nPage | 21 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Harry was dressed Harry went down the hall into \\r\\nthe kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all \\r\\nDudley’s birthday presents. The table looked as though \\r\\nDudley’s had gotten the new computer Dudley’s wanted, not \\r\\nto mention the second television and the racing bike. \\r\\nExactly why Dudley’s wanted a racing bike was a \\r\\nmystery to Harry, as Dudley’s was very fat and hated \\r\\nexercise — unless of course it involved punching \\r\\nsomebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, \\r\\nbut Dudley’s couldn’t often catch Dudley’s. Harry didn’t look it, \\r\\nbut Harry was very fast. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark \\r\\ncupboard, but Harry had always been small and \\r\\nskinny for Harry age. Harry looked even smaller and \\r\\nskinnier than Harry really was because all Harry had to \\r\\nwear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley’s was \\r\\nabout four times bigger than Harry was. Harry had a thin \\r\\nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green \\r\\neyes. Harry wore round glasses held together with a lot \\r\\nof Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley’s had \\r\\npunched Harry on the nose. The only thing Harry liked \\r\\nabout Harry own appearance was a very thin scar on Harry \\r\\nforehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. Harry \\r\\nhad had it as long as Harry could remember, and the \\r\\nfirst question Harry could ever remember asking His Aunt Petunia was how Harry had gotten it. \\r\\n\\r\\n“In the car crash when your parents died,” His Aunt Petunia had \\r\\nsaid. “And don’t ask questions.” \\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a \\r\\nquiet life with the Dursleys. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon entered \\r\\nthe kitchen as Harry was \\r\\nturning over the bacon. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Comb your hair!” Uncle Vernon barked, by way of a morning \\r\\ngreeting. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 22 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top \\r\\nof Uncle Vernon newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a \\r\\nhaircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the \\r\\nrest of the boys in Harry class put together, but it made \\r\\nno difference, Harry hair simply grew that way — all over \\r\\nthe place. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley’s arrived in \\r\\nthe kitchen with his \\r\\nmother. Dudley’s looked a lot like Uncle VernonUncle Vernon. Dudley’s had a large pink face, not much \\r\\nneck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair \\r\\nthat lay smoothly on Dudley’s thick, fat head. His Aunt Petuniaoften said that Dudley’s looked like a baby angel — \\r\\nHarry often said that Dudley’s looked like a pig in a \\r\\nwig. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, \\r\\nwhich was difficult as there wasn’t much room. \\r\\nDudley’s, meanwhile, was counting Dudley’s presents. Dudley’s \\r\\nface fell. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thirty-six,” Dudley’s said, looking up at Dudley’s mother and \\r\\nfather. “That’s two less than last year.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, \\r\\nsee, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and \\r\\nDaddy.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley’s, going red \\r\\nin His \\r\\nface. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley \\r\\ntantrum coming on, began wolfing down Dudley \\r\\n bacon as \\r\\nfast as possible in case Dudley’s turned the table over. \\r\\n\\r\\nHis Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because \\r\\nHis Aunt Petunia said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two \\r\\npresents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? \\r\\nTwo more presents. Is that all right?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 23 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard \\r\\nwork. Finally Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDudley said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty ... \\r\\nthirty ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said His Aunt Petunia. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh.” Dudley’s sat down heavily and grabbed the \\r\\nnearest parcel. “All right then.” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Little tyke wants Little tyke money’s worth, just like Little tyke \\r\\nfather. ’Atta boy, Dudley’s!” Atta boy, Dudley!” ruffled his money’s hair. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the telephone rang and His Aunt Petuniawent to answer the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia \\r\\n while Harry and Uncle Vernon \\r\\nwatched Dudley’s unwrap the racing bike, a video \\r\\ncamera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new \\r\\ncomputer games, and a VCR. Atta boy, Dudley!” was ripping the \\r\\npaper off a gold wristwatch when His Aunt Petunia came \\r\\nback from the telephone looking both angry and \\r\\nworried. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bad news, Uncle Vernon,” His Aunt Petunia said. “his money’s broken his money’s \\r\\nleg. his money’s can’t take Atta boy, Dudley!”.” his money’s jerked his money’s head in \\r\\nHarry’s direction. \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley’s’s mouth fell open in horror, but his money’s heart \\r\\ngave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s’s birthday, Dudley’s \\r\\nparents took Dudley’s and a friend out for the day, to \\r\\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the \\r\\nmovies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. \\r\\nFigg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry hated it there. The whole house smelled of \\r\\ncabbage and Mrs. Figg made Harry look at photographs \\r\\nof all the cats she’d ever owned. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now what?” said His Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry Harry as though Harry’d planned this. Harry knew Harry \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 24 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken Mrs. Figg leg, \\r\\nbut it wasn’t easy when Mrs. Figg reminded Mrs. Figg it would \\r\\nbe a whole year before Mrs. Figg had to look at Tibbies, \\r\\nSnowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be silly, Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon hates a large blond boy.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as \\r\\nthough Harry wasn’t there — or rather, as though Harry was \\r\\nsomething very nasty that couldn’t understand them, \\r\\nlike a slug. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — \\r\\nYvonne?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped His Aunt Petunia. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully \\r\\n(he’d be able to watch what Harry wanted on television \\r\\nfor a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s \\r\\ncomputer) . \\r\\n\\r\\nHis Aunt Petunia looked as though His Aunt Petunia’d just swallowed a \\r\\nlemon. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And come back and find The whole house smelled of \\r\\ncabbage in ruins?” His Aunt Petunia \\r\\nsnarled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t blow up The whole house smelled of \\r\\ncabbage,” said Harry, but they \\r\\nweren’t listening. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose we could take Harry to the zoo,” said Aunt \\r\\nPetunia slowly, \"... and leave Harry in the car. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“That cars new, Harry’s not sitting in it alone. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 25 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDudley’s began to cry loudly. In fact, Dudley’s wasn’t really \\r\\ncrying — it had been years since Dudley’s’d really cried — \\r\\nbut Dudley’s knew that if Dudley’s screwed up Dudley’s face and \\r\\nwailed, Dudley’s would give Dudley’s anything Dudley’s \\r\\nwanted. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let Dudley’s \\r\\nspoil your special day!” his \\r\\nmother cried, flinging his \\r\\nmother arms \\r\\naround Dudley’s. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!” Dudley’syelled between huge, pretend sobs. “Dudley’s always sp- \\r\\nspoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through \\r\\nthe gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, \\r\\nthey’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a \\r\\nmoment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, \\r\\nwalked in with Dudley’s . Piers was a scrawny boy \\r\\nwith a face like a rat. a scrawny boy \\r\\n was usually the one who \\r\\nheld people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley’shit their. Dudley’s stopped pretending to cry at once. \\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe Dudley’s \\r\\nluck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with \\r\\nPiers and Dudley’s, on the way to the zoo for the first \\r\\ntime in Dudley’s life. Dudley’s aunt and uncle hadn’t been able \\r\\nto think of anything else to do with Dudley’s, but before \\r\\nHis aunt and uncle’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m warning you,” Uncle Vernon had said, putting Uncle Vernon large \\r\\npurple face right up close to his money’s, “I’m warning you \\r\\nnow, boy — any funny business, anything at all — \\r\\nand you’ll be in that cupboard from now until \\r\\nChristmas.” \\r\\n\\r\\nI’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 26 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Uncle Vernon didn’t believe Uncle Vernon. No one ever did. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem was, strange things often happened \\r\\naround Harry and The problem was just no good telling the \\r\\nDursleys Harry didn’t make the \\r\\nDursleys happen. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from \\r\\nthe barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, \\r\\nhad taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair \\r\\nso short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, \\r\\nwhich she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had \\r\\nlaughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless \\r\\nnight imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was \\r\\nalready laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped \\r\\nglasses. Next morning, however, Dudley’s had gotten up to \\r\\nfind his hair \\r\\n exactly as his hair \\r\\n had been before His Aunt Petunia had sheared his hair \\r\\n off. His Aunt Petunia had been given a week \\r\\nin His Aunt Petunia cupboard for this, even though His Aunt Petunia had tried to \\r\\nexplain that His Aunt Petunia couldn’t explain how it had grown \\r\\nback so quickly. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother time, His Aunt Petunia had been trying to force \\r\\nHis Aunt Petunia into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown \\r\\nwith orange puff balls). The harder His Aunt Petunia tried to pull The \\r\\nover His Aunt Petunia head, the smaller it seemed to become, until \\r\\nfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but \\r\\ncertainly wouldn’t fit Harry. His Aunt Petunia had decided \\r\\nit must have shrunk in the wash and, to His Aunt Petunia great \\r\\nrelief, Harry wasn’t punished. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, Harry’d gotten into terrible trouble \\r\\nfor being found on the roof of the school kitchens. \\r\\nDudley’s gang had been chasing Harry as usual when, \\r\\nas much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there Harry \\r\\nwas sitting on the chimney. the Dursleys had \\r\\nreceived a very angry letter from his money’s headmistress \\r\\ntelling them Harry had been climbing school \\r\\nbuildings. But all he’d tried to do (as all he’d shouted at Uncle Vernon Uncle Vernon through the locked door of Uncle Vernon \\r\\nPage | 27 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans \\r\\noutside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the \\r\\nwind must have caught Harry in mid-jump. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even \\r\\nworth being with Dudley’s and Piers to be spending the \\r\\nday somewhere that wasn’t school, Dudley’s cupboard, or \\r\\nMrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Dudley’s drove, Uncle Vernon complained to His Aunt Petunia. Uncle Vernon liked to complain about things: people at \\r\\nwork, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harrywere just a few of Uncle Vernon favorite subjects. This morning, \\r\\nThis morning was motorcycles. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” \\r\\nhe said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, \\r\\nremembering suddenly. “It was flying.” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. Uncle Vernon \\r\\nturned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, \\r\\nUncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \\r\\n“MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley and Piers sniggered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Harry wished Harry hadn’t said anything. If there was \\r\\none thing the Dursleys hated even more than Harry \\r\\nasking questions, it was Harry talking about anything \\r\\nacting in a way the Dursleys shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a \\r\\ndream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think Harry \\r\\nmight get dangerous ideas. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was \\r\\ncrowded with families. the Dursleys bought Dudley \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 28 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nand Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance \\r\\nand then, because the smiling lady in the van had \\r\\nasked Harry what Harry wanted before they could hurry \\r\\nHarry away, they bought Harry a cheap lemon ice pop. It \\r\\nwasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking It as they \\r\\nwatched a gorilla scratching It head who looked \\r\\nremarkably like Dudley’s, except that it wasn’t blond. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had the best morning Harry’d had in a long time. \\r\\nHarry was careful to walk a little way apart from the \\r\\nDursleys so that Dudley’s and Piers, who were starting \\r\\nto get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t \\r\\nfall back on the animals favorite hobby of hitting Harry. the animals \\r\\nate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley’s had a \\r\\ntantrum because Dudley’s knickerbocker glory didn’t have \\r\\nenough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought Dudley’s \\r\\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry felt, afterward, that Harry should have known it \\r\\nwas all too good to last. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter lunch another one and Harry went to the reptile house. the reptile house was cool \\r\\nand dark in there, with lit windows all along the \\r\\nwalls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes \\r\\nwere crawling and slithering over bits of wood and \\r\\nstone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, \\r\\npoisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. \\r\\nDudley’s quickly found the largest snake in the place. the largest snake in the place \\r\\ncould have wrapped the largest snake in the place body twice around Uncle \\r\\nVernon’s car and crushed its body into a trash can — but at \\r\\nthe moment its body didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was \\r\\nfast asleep. \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley’s stood with Dudley’s nose pressed against the glass, \\r\\nstaring at the glistening brown coils. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Make it move,” Dudley’s whined at Dudley’s father. Uncle Vernontapped on the glass, but the largest snake in the place didn’t budge. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 29 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do it again,” Dudley’s ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped \\r\\nthe glass smartly with Uncle Vernon knuckles, but the largest snake in the placejust snoozed on. \\r\\n\\r\\n“This is boring,” Dudley’s moaned. Dudley’s shuffled away. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently \\r\\nat the largest snake in the place. Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if the largest snake in the place \\r\\nhad died of boredom itself — no company except \\r\\nstupid people drumming their fingers on the glass \\r\\ntrying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than \\r\\nhaving a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only \\r\\nvisitor was His Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to \\r\\nwake you up; at least Harry got to visit the rest of the \\r\\nhouse. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe largest snake in the place suddenly opened the largest snake in the place beady eyes. Slowly, \\r\\nvery slowly, the largest snake in the place raised the largest snake in the place head until its beady eyes were on a \\r\\nlevel with his money’s. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe largest snake in the place winked. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stared. Then Harry looked quickly around to see if \\r\\nanyone was watching. anyone weren’t. Harry looked back \\r\\nat the largest snake in the place and winked, too. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe largest snake in the place jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and \\r\\nDudley, then raised its beady eyes to the ceiling. the largest snake in the place gave \\r\\nHarry a look that said quite plainly: \\r\\n\\r\\n“I get that all the time.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though \\r\\nHarry wasn’t sure the largest snake in the place could hear Harry. “It must be \\r\\nreally annoying.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe largest snake in the place nodded vigorously. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 30 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe largest snake in the place jabbed the largest snake in the place tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at the glass. \\r\\n\\r\\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Was it nice there?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe boa constrictor jabbed The boa constrictor at a little sign again \\r\\nand Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the \\r\\nzoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the largest snake in the place shook the largest snake in the place head, a deafening shout \\r\\nbehind Harry made both of a deafening shout \\r\\nbehind Harry jump. “DUDLEY! \\r\\nMR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT the largest snake in the placeYOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley’s came waddling toward them as fast as Dudley’s \\r\\ncould. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Out of the way, you,” Dudley’s said, punching Harry in the \\r\\nribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the \\r\\nconcrete floor. What came next happened so fast no \\r\\none saw how it happened — one second, Piers and \\r\\nDudley’s were leaning right up close to the glass, the \\r\\nnext, Piers and \\r\\nDudley had leapt back with howls of horror. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa \\r\\nconstrictor’s tank had vanished. the largest snake in the place was \\r\\nuncoiling the largest snake in the place rapidly, slithering out onto the \\r\\nconcrete floor. \\r\\nPeople throughout the reptile house screamed and \\r\\nstarted running for the exits. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the largest snake in the place slid swiftly past him, Harry could have \\r\\nsworn a low, hissing voice said, BrazilBrazil, here I come. \\r\\n... Thanksss, amigo.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 31 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass \\r\\ngo?” \" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe zoo director himself made His Aunt Petunia a cup of \\r\\nstrong, sweet tea while The zoo director himself apologized over and over \\r\\nagain. Piers and \\r\\nDudley could only gibber. As far as \\r\\nHarry had seen, the largest snake in the place hadn’t done anything \\r\\nexcept snap playfully at Piers and \\r\\nDudley heels as the largest snake in the place passed, but \\r\\nby the time Piers and \\r\\nDudley were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, \\r\\nDudley’s was telling Piers and \\r\\nDudley how the largest snake in the place had nearly bitten off \\r\\nDudley’s leg, while Piers was swearing the largest snake in the place had tried to \\r\\nsqueeze Dudley’s to death. But worst of all, for Harry at \\r\\nleast, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harrywas talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the \\r\\nhouse before starting on Harry. Uncle Vernon was so angry Uncle Vernon \\r\\ncould hardly speak. Uncle Vernon managed to say, “Go — \\r\\ncupboard — stay — no meals,” before Uncle Vernon collapsed \\r\\ninto a chair, and His Aunt Petunia had to run and get \\r\\nUncle Vernon a large brandy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry lay in — \\r\\ncupboard much later, wishing \\r\\nHarry had a watch. Harry didn’t know what time it was and \\r\\nHarry couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil they were, Harry couldn’t risk sneaking to the \\r\\nkitchen for some food. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten \\r\\nmiserable years, as long as Harry could remember, ever \\r\\nsince Harry’d been a baby and Harry parents had died in \\r\\nthat car crash. Harry couldn’t remember being in the car \\r\\nwhen his parents had died. Sometimes, when Harry \\r\\nstrained Harry memory during long hours in Harry \\r\\ncupboard, Harry came up with a strange vision: a \\r\\nblinding flash of green light and a burning pain on Harry \\r\\nforehead. This, Harry supposed, was that car crash, though \\r\\nHarry couldn’t imagine where all the green light came \\r\\nfrom. Harry couldn’t remember his parents at all. Harry \\r\\nPage | 32 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\naunt and uncle never spoke about the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\naunt and uncle, and of \\r\\ncourse Harry was forbidden to ask questions. There were \\r\\nno photographs of the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\naunt and uncle in the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Harry had been younger, Harry had dreamed and \\r\\ndreamed of some unknown relation coming to take \\r\\nHarry away, but it had never happened; the Dursleyswere Harry only family. Yet sometimes Harry thought (or \\r\\nmaybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to \\r\\nknow Harry. Very strange strangers they were, too. A \\r\\ntiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to A \\r\\ntiny man in a violet top hat once \\r\\nwhile out shopping with His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s. \\r\\nAfter asking Harry furiously if Harry knew A \\r\\ntiny man in a violet top hat, Aunt \\r\\nPetunia had rushed them out of the shop without \\r\\nbuying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed \\r\\nall in green had waved merrily at Harry once on a bus. \\r\\n\\r\\nA bald man in a very long purple coat had actually \\r\\nshaken A bald man in a very long purple coat hand in the street the other day and then \\r\\nwalked away without a word. The weirdest thing \\r\\nabout all these people was the way all these people seemed to \\r\\nvanish Harry Harry tried to get a closer look. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that \\r\\nDudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s \\r\\nbaggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody \\r\\nliked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 33 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned \\r\\nHarry The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor longest-ever punishment. By the time The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor \\r\\nwas allowed out of The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor cupboard again, the summer \\r\\nholidays had started and Dudley’s had already broken \\r\\nDudley’s new video camera, crashed Dudley’s remote control \\r\\nairplane, and, first time out on Dudley’s racing bike, \\r\\nknocked down old Mrs. Figg as old Mrs. Figg crossed Privet \\r\\nDrive on old Mrs. Figg crutches. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no \\r\\nescaping Dudley’s’s gang, who visited the house every \\r\\nsingle day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were \\r\\nall big and stupid, but as Dudley’s was the biggest and \\r\\nstupidest of the lot, Dudley’s was the leader. The rest of \\r\\nPiers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s’s favorite \\r\\nsport: Harry Hunting. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible \\r\\nout of the house, wandering around and thinking \\r\\nabout the end of the holidays, where Harry could see a \\r\\ntiny ray of hope. When September came Harry would be \\r\\ngoing off to secondary school and, for the first time in \\r\\nPage | 34 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry life, Harry wouldn’t be with Dudley’s. Dudley’s had been \\r\\naccepted at Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old private school, \\r\\nSmeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, \\r\\non the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the \\r\\nlocal public school. Dudley’s thought this was very \\r\\nfunny. \\r\\n\\r\\n“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day \\r\\nat Stonewall,” Dudley’s told Harry. “Want to come upstairs \\r\\nand practice?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had \\r\\nanything as horrible as your head down it — it might \\r\\nbe sick.” Then Dudley’s ran, before Dudley’s could work out \\r\\nwhat Dudley’s’d said. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne day in July, His Aunt Petunia took Dudley’s to London \\r\\nto buy His Aunt Petunia Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. \\r\\nFigg’s. old Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. old Mrs. Figg turned out \\r\\nold Mrs. Figg’d broken old Mrs. Figg leg tripping over one of old Mrs. Figg cats, and \\r\\nold Mrs. Figg didn’t seem quite as fond of her cats as before. old Mrs. Figg \\r\\nlet Harry watch television and gave Harry a bit of \\r\\nchocolate cake that tasted as though old Mrs. Figg’d had ’d for \\r\\nseveral years. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening, Dudley’s paraded around the living room \\r\\nfor the family in Dudley’s brand-new uniform. Smeltings \\r\\nboys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, \\r\\nand flat straw hats called boaters. Smeltings \\r\\nboys also carried \\r\\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the \\r\\nteachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be \\r\\ngood training for later life. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs he looked at Dudley’s in he new knickerbockers, \\r\\nUncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest \\r\\nmoment of he life. His Aunt Petunia burst into tears and \\r\\nsaid His Aunt Petunia couldn’t believe it was His Aunt Petunia Ickle Dudleykins, \\r\\nHis Aunt Petunia looked so handsome and grown-up.

It seemed \\r\\nto be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. Harry \\r\\nwent to have a look. a large metal tub in the sink was full of what looked \\r\\nlike dirty rags swimming in gray water. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s this?” the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n dared to ask a \\r\\nquestion. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Your new school uniform,” His Aunt Petunia said. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked in the bowl again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” Harry said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be stupid,” snapped His Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing \\r\\nsome of Dudley’s old things gray for Harry. It’ll look just \\r\\nlike everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought this best not \\r\\nto argue. Harry sat down at the table and tried not to \\r\\nthink about how Harry was going to look on Harry first day \\r\\nat Stonewall High — like Harry was wearing bits of old \\r\\nelephant skin, probably. \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley’s and Uncle Vernon came in, both with \\r\\nwrinkled noses because of the smell from Mrs. \\r\\nFigg’s new \\r\\nuniform. Uncle Vernon opened Uncle Vernon newspaper as \\r\\nusual and Dudley’s banged Uncle Vernon Smelting stick, which \\r\\nUncle Vernon carried everywhere, on the table. \\r\\n\\r\\nboth with \\r\\nwrinkled noses heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters \\r\\non the doormat. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 36 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get the mail, Dudley’s,” said Uncle Vernon from \\r\\nbehind Uncle Vernon paper. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Make Harry get it.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Get the mail, Harry.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Make Dudley’s get it.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Poke Dudley’s with your Smelting stick, Dudley’s.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry dodged your Smelting stick, Dudley and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard \\r\\nfrom Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was \\r\\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope \\r\\nthat looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry picked a bill up and stared at a bill, Harry heart twanging \\r\\nlike a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in Harry whole \\r\\nlife, had written to Harry. Who would? Harry had no \\r\\nfriends, no other relatives — Harry didn’t belong to the \\r\\nlibrary, so Harry’d never even got rude notes asking for \\r\\nbooks back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so \\r\\nplainly there could be no mistake: \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. H. Potter \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs \\r\\n4 Privet Drive \\r\\nLittle Whinging \\r\\nSurrey \\r\\n\\r\\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish \\r\\nparchment, and the address was written in emerald- \\r\\ngreen ink. There was no stamp. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 37 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning The envelope over, Page | 37 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n hand trembling, Harrysaw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, \\r\\nan eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large \\r\\nletter H. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the \\r\\nkitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter \\r\\nbombs?” Harry chuckled at Harry own joke. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry went back to the \\r\\nkitchen, still staring at a letter. Harry handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the \\r\\npostcard, sat down, and slowly began to open The envelope. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, \\r\\nand flipped over the postcard. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. \\r\\nFigg’s,” Uncle Vernon informed His Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny \\r\\nwhelk ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dad!” said Dudley’s suddenly. “Dad, Mrs. \\r\\nFigg’s got \\r\\nsomething!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was on the point of unfolding Harry letter, which \\r\\nwas written on the same heavy parchment as the \\r\\nenvelope, when it was jerked sharply out of Harry hand \\r\\nby Uncle Vernon. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s mine\\\\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, \\r\\nshaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at \\r\\nit. Harry face went from red to green faster than a set of \\r\\ntraffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds \\r\\nit was the grayish white of old porridge. \\r\\n\\r\\n“P-P-Petunia!” P-P-Petunia gasped. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 38 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of Uncle Vernon reach. His Aunt Petuniatook it curiously and read the first line. For a moment \\r\\nit looked as though His Aunt Petunia might faint. His Aunt Petunia clutched His Aunt Petunia \\r\\nthroat and made a choking noise. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle VernonUncle Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten \\r\\nthat Harry and Dudley’s were still in the room. Dudley’swasn’t used to being ignored. Dudley’s gave Dudley’s father a \\r\\nsharp tap on the head with Dudley’s Smelting stick. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to read a letter,” Dudley’s said loudly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to read a letter,” said Harry furiously, “as a letter’s mine.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing \\r\\nthe letter back inside a letter envelope. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry didn’t move. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I WANT MY LETTER!” Harry shouted. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley’s. \\r\\n\\r\\n“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and Uncle Vernon took both Harryand Dudley’s by the scruffs of both necks and threw \\r\\nboth into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind \\r\\nboth. Harry \\r\\nand Dudley promptly had a furious but \\r\\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; \\r\\nDudley’s won, so Harry, Harry glasses dangling from one \\r\\near, lay flat on Harry stomach to listen at the crack \\r\\nbetween door and floor. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon,” His Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering \\r\\nvoice, “look at the address — how could they possibly \\r\\nknow where Harry sleeps? You don’t think they’re \\r\\nwatching the house?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 39 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Watching — spying — might be following us,” \\r\\nmuttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But what should us do, Uncle Vernon? Should us write \\r\\nback? Tell they us don’t want — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes \\r\\npacing up and down the kitchen. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” Harry said finally. “No, us’ll ignore it. If they don’t \\r\\nget an answer. ... Yes, that’s best ... us won’t do \\r\\nanything. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t us \\r\\nswear when us took — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n in we’d stamp out that \\r\\ndangerous nonsense?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening when — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n’d never done before; ’dvisited Harry in — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n cupboard. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where’s a letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s \\r\\nwriting to me?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No one. No one was addressed to you by mistake,” said \\r\\nUncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned No one.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “It had my \\r\\ncupboard on It.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of \\r\\nspiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep \\r\\nbreaths and then forced He face into a smile, which \\r\\nlooked quite painful. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 40 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt \\r\\nand I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit \\r\\nbig for a bit \\r\\n . . . we think it might be nice if you moved \\r\\ninto Dudley’s’s second bedroom.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t ask questions!” snapped Uncle \\r\\n. “Take this \\r\\nstuff upstairs, now.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for \\r\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors \\r\\n(usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where \\r\\nDudley’s slept, and one where Dudley’s kept all the toys \\r\\nand things that wouldn’t fit into Dudley’s first bedroom. It \\r\\nonly took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything \\r\\nHarry owned from this cupboard to this room. Harry sat \\r\\ndown on the bed and stared around Harry. Nearly \\r\\neverything in here was broken. The month-old video \\r\\ncamera was lying on top of a small, working tank \\r\\nDudley’s had once driven over the next door neighbor’s \\r\\ndog; in the corner was Dudley’s’s first-ever television \\r\\nset, which Dudley’s’d put Dudley’s foot through when Dudley’s favorite \\r\\nprogram had been canceled; there was a large \\r\\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley’shad swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was \\r\\nup on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley’shad sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. Other shelves \\r\\nwere the only things in the room that looked as \\r\\nthough Other shelves’d never been touched. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley’s bawling \\r\\nat Dudley’s mother, “I don’t want Dudley’s in there ... I need \\r\\nthis room ... make Dudley’s get out. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday \\r\\nHarry’d have given anything to be up here. Today Dudley’s’d \\r\\nrather be back in this cupboard with that letter than \\r\\nup here without ’d \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 41 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. \\r\\nDudley’s was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, \\r\\nkicked his mother, and thrown Dudley’s tortoise through \\r\\nthe greenhouse roof, and Dudley’s still didn’t have Dudley’s room \\r\\nback. Harry was thinking about this time Yesterday \\r\\nand bitterly wishing Harry’d opened the letter in the hall. \\r\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each \\r\\nother darkly. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to \\r\\nbe trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley’s go and get \\r\\nit. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia heard Dudley’s banging things with Dudley’s Smelting \\r\\nstick all the way down the hall. Then Dudley’s shouted, \\r\\n“There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest \\r\\nBedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ’ ” \\r\\n\\r\\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from Uncle Vernon \\r\\nseat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind Harry. \\r\\nUncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to \\r\\nget the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by \\r\\nthe fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around \\r\\nthe neck from behind. After a minute of confused \\r\\nfighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the \\r\\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, \\r\\ngasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in Harry \\r\\nhand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” Harry \\r\\nwheezed at Harry. “Dudley’s — go — just go.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry walked round and round Harry new room. \\r\\nSomeone knew Someone had moved out of Someone and \\r\\nthey seemed to know Someone hadn’t received Someone . Surely that meant they’d try again? And this \\r\\ntime Someone’d make sure they didn’t fail. Someone had a plan. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next \\r\\nmorning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 42 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsilently. Page | 42 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsilently mustn’t wake the Dursleys. Page | 42 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsilently crept across the halltoward the front door — \\r\\n\\r\\n“AAAAARRRGH ! ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry leapt into the air; Harry’d trodden on something \\r\\nbig and squashy on the doormat — something alive\\\\ \\r\\n\\r\\nLights clicked on upstairs and to Harry horror Harryrealized that the big, squashy something had been Harry \\r\\nuncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot \\r\\nof the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making \\r\\nsure that Harry didn’t do exactly what Harry’d been \\r\\ntrying to do. Uncle Vernon shouted at Harry for about half an \\r\\nhour and then told Harry to go and make a cup of tea. \\r\\nHarry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by \\r\\nthe time Harry got back, the mail had arrived, right into \\r\\nUncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters \\r\\naddressed in green ink. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I want — ” Harry began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing \\r\\nthree letters \\r\\n before Uncle Vernon eyes. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. Uncle Vernon stayed at \\r\\nhome and nailed up the mail slot. \\r\\n\\r\\n“See,” Uncle Vernon explained to His Aunt Petunia through a \\r\\nmouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver they they ca’ll \\r\\njust give up.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not sure that’ll work, Uncle Vernon.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, \\r\\nPetunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 43 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of \\r\\nfruitcake His Aunt Petunia had just brought -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of \\r\\nfruitcake. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for HarryHarry. As no less than twelve letters couldn’t go through the mail slot no less than twelve letters \\r\\nhad been pushed under the door, slotted through the \\r\\nsides, and a few even forced through the small \\r\\nwindow in the downstairs bathroom. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all \\r\\nthe letters, Uncle Vernon got out a hammer and nails and \\r\\nboarded up the cracks around the front and back \\r\\ndoors so no one could go out. Uncle Vernon hummed “Tiptoe \\r\\nThrough the Tulips” as Uncle Vernon worked, and jumped at \\r\\nsmall noises. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. \\r\\nTwenty-four letters to Harry found Twenty-four letters to Harry way into the \\r\\nhouse, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two \\r\\ndozen eggs that Twenty-four letters to Harry very confused milkman had \\r\\nhanded His Aunt Petunia through the living room \\r\\nwindow. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone \\r\\ncalls to the post office and the dairy trying to find \\r\\nsomeone to complain to, His Aunt Petunia shredded the \\r\\nletters in His Aunt Petunia food processor. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” \\r\\nDudley’s asked Harry in amazement. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n•k k k \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the \\r\\nbreakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No post on Sundays,” Uncle Vernon reminded them cheerfully \\r\\nas Uncle Vernon spread marmalade on Uncle Vernon newspapers, “no \\r\\ndamn letters today — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 44 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney \\r\\nas Something spoke and caught Something sharply on the back of \\r\\nthe head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came \\r\\npelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys \\r\\nducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch \\r\\none — \\r\\n\\r\\n“Out! OUT!Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and \\r\\nthrew Harry into the hall. When His Aunt Petunia and \\r\\nDudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and \\r\\nDudley arms over Aunt Petunia and \\r\\nDudley faces, \\r\\nUncle Vernon slammed the door shut. Aunt Petunia and \\r\\nDudley could \\r\\nhear Twenty-four letters to Harry still streaming into the room, \\r\\nbouncing off the walls and floor. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak \\r\\ncalmly but pulling great tufts out of Uncle Vernon mustache at \\r\\nthe same time. “I want you all back here in five \\r\\nminutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack \\r\\nsome clothes. No arguments!” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon looked so dangerous with half Uncle Vernon mustache \\r\\nmissing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later \\r\\nthey had wrenched they way through the boarded-up \\r\\ndoors and were in the car, speeding toward the \\r\\nhighway. Dudley’s was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit Dudley’s round the head for holding they \\r\\nup while Dudley’s tried to pack Dudley’s television, VCR, and \\r\\ncomputer in Dudley’s sports bag. \\r\\n\\r\\nthey drove. And they drove. His Aunt Petunia didn’t \\r\\ndare ask where they were going. Every now and then \\r\\nUncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in \\r\\nthe opposite direction for a while. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” Shake ’em off would mutter \\r\\nwhenever Shake ’em off did this. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 45 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n45 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall \\r\\nDudley’s was howling. He’d never had such a bad day \\r\\nin Dudley’s life. Dudley’s was hungry, Dudley’s’d missed five television \\r\\nprograms Dudley’s’d wanted to see, and Dudley’s’d never gone so \\r\\nlong without blowing up an alien on Dudley’s computer. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- \\r\\nlooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley’sand Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, \\r\\nmusty sheets. Dudley’s snored but Harry stayed awake, \\r\\nsitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of \\r\\npassing cars and wondering... \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley \\r\\nand Harry ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on \\r\\ntoast for breakfast the next day. Dudley \\r\\nand Harry had just \\r\\nfinished when the owner of a gloomy- \\r\\nlooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city came over to \\r\\nDudley \\r\\nand Harry table. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I \\r\\ngot about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman held up a letter so Dudley \\r\\nand Harry could read the green ink \\r\\naddress: \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. H. Potter \\r\\n\\r\\nRoom 1 7 \\r\\n\\r\\nRailview Hotel \\r\\n\\r\\nCokeworth \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry made a grab for a letter but Uncle Vernonknocked Uncle Vernon hand out of the way. The woman stared. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up \\r\\nquickly and following The woman from the dining room. \\r\\n\\r\\n•k k k \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 46 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” His Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear The woman. Exactly what Uncle Vernon was \\r\\nlooking for, none of them knew. Uncle Vernon drove them into \\r\\nthe middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook \\r\\nUncle Vernon head, got back in the car, and off them went again. \\r\\nThe same thing happened in the middle of a plowed \\r\\nfield, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the \\r\\ntop of a multilevel parking garage. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t Uncle Vernon?” Dudley’s asked His Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had \\r\\nparked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, \\r\\nand disappeared. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley’s sniveled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s Monday,” Uncle Vernon told Uncle Vernon mother. “The Great \\r\\nHumberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with \\r\\na television.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was \\r\\nMonday — and you could usually count on Dudley’s to \\r\\nknow the days of the week, because of television — \\r\\nthen tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh \\r\\nbirthday. Of course, Uncle Vernon birthdays were never exactly \\r\\nfun — last year, the Dursleys had given Uncle Vernon a coat \\r\\nhanger and a pair of Uncle Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, \\r\\nyou weren’t eleven every day. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon was back and Uncle Vernon was smiling. Uncle Vernon was \\r\\nalso carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer \\r\\nHis Aunt Petunia when His Aunt Petunia asked what Uncle Vernon’d bought. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Found the perfect place!” Uncle Vernon said. “Come on! \\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone out!” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 47 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was \\r\\npointing at what looked like a large rock way out at \\r\\nsea. Perched on top of the rock was the most \\r\\nmiserable little shack you could imagine. One thing \\r\\nwas certain, there was no television in there. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernongleefully, clapping Uncle Vernon hands together. “And this \\r\\ngentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us this \\r\\ngentleman’s boat!” \\r\\n\\r\\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, \\r\\npointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat \\r\\nbobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, \\r\\n“so all aboard!” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was freezing in his boat. Icy sea spray and rain \\r\\ncrept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped \\r\\ntheir faces. After what seemed like hours their \\r\\nreached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and \\r\\nsliding, led the way to the broken-down house. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe inside was horrible; The inside smelled strongly of \\r\\nseaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the \\r\\nwooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. \\r\\nThere were only two rooms. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips \\r\\neach and four bananas. Uncle Vernon’s rations tried to start a fire but the \\r\\nempty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” Uncle Vernon’s rations said \\r\\ncheerfully. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon’s rations was in a very good mood. Obviously Uncle Vernon’s rations thought \\r\\nnobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a \\r\\nstorm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though \\r\\nthe thought didn’t cheer Harry up at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 48 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around \\r\\nthem. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls \\r\\nof the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy \\r\\nwindows. His Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in \\r\\nthe second room and made up a bed for Dudley’s on \\r\\nthe moth-eaten sofa. His Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon went off \\r\\nto the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find \\r\\nthe softest bit of floor Harry could and to curl up under \\r\\nthe thinnest, most ragged blanket. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe promised storm raged more and more ferociously as the \\r\\nnight went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. Harry shivered and \\r\\nturned over, trying to get comfortable, Harry stomach \\r\\nrumbling with hunger. Dudley’s’s snores were drowned \\r\\nby the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. \\r\\nThe lighted dial of Dudley’s’s watch, which was \\r\\ndangling over the edge of \\r\\nthe moth-eaten sofa on Dudley’s fat wrist, told \\r\\nHarry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. Harry lay and \\r\\nwatched Harry birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the \\r\\nletter writer was now. \\r\\n\\r\\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak \\r\\noutside. Harry hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, \\r\\nalthough Harry might be warmer if the roof did. Four minutes \\r\\nto go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so \\r\\nfull of letters when letters got back that Harry’d be able to \\r\\nsteal one somehow. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard \\r\\non the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what \\r\\nwas that funny crunching noise? Was the rock \\r\\ncrumbling into \\r\\nsea? \\r\\n\\r\\nOne minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds \\r\\n... twenty ... ten ... nine — maybe Harry’d wake Dudley’sup, just to annoy Harry — three ... two ... one ... \\r\\n\\r\\nBOOM. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 49 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, \\r\\nstaring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking \\r\\nto come in. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 50 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Dudley’s jerked awake. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where’s the cannon?” Dudley’s said stupidly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernoncame skidding into the second room. Uncle Vernon was holding a rifle in \\r\\nUncle Vernon hands — now they knew what had been in the \\r\\nlong, thin package Uncle Vernon had brought with they. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s there?” Uncle Vernon shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a pause. Then — \\r\\n\\r\\nSMASH! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe door was hit with such force that the door swung clean \\r\\noff the door hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat \\r\\non the floor. \\r\\n\\r\\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. A giant of a man \\r\\nface was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy \\r\\nmane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 51 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmake out J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n eyes, glinting like black beetles under \\r\\nall the hair. \\r\\n\\r\\nA giant of a man squeezed J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n way into the hut, stooping so \\r\\nthat J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n head just brushed the ceiling. J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n bent down, \\r\\npicked up the door, and fitted the door easily back into the door \\r\\nframe. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. \\r\\nJ.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n turned to look at them all. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not \\r\\nbeen an easy journey. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nJ.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n strode over to the sofa where Dudley’s sat frozen \\r\\nwith fear. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger. \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley’s squeaked and ran to hide behind Dudley’s mother, \\r\\nwho was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \\r\\n\\r\\n“An’ here’s Harry!” said A giant of a man. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face \\r\\nand saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said A giant of a man. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer \\r\\nmom’s eyes.Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” sir said. “You \\r\\nare breaking and entering!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said A giant of a man; A giant of a man reached over the back of the sofa where Dudley sat frozen \\r\\nwith fear, jerked the \\r\\ngun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent the \\r\\ngun into a knot \\r\\nas easily as if the \\r\\ngun had been made of rubber, and threw \\r\\nthe \\r\\ngun into a corner of the second room. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 52 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a \\r\\nmouse being trodden on. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Anyway Harry,” said A giant of a man, turning Harry back \\r\\non the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to Yeh. Got \\r\\nsummat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some \\r\\npoint, but it’ll taste all right.” \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an inside pocket of Yeh black overcoat Yeh pulled \\r\\na slightly squashed box. Harry opened a slightly squashed box with \\r\\ntrembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate \\r\\ncake with Harry written on a slightly squashed box in green \\r\\nicing. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked up at A giant of a man. Harry meant to say thank \\r\\nyou, but the words got lost on the way to Harry mouth, \\r\\nand what Harry said instead was, “Who are you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nA giant of a man chuckled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, \\r\\nKeeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s \\r\\nwhole arm. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What about that tea then, eh?” Harry said, rubbing Harry \\r\\nhands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if \\r\\n\\r\\n got \\r\\n, mind.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled \\r\\nchip bags in His eyes and Harry snorted. Harry bent down over the \\r\\nfireplace; they couldn’t see what Harry was doing but \\r\\nwhen Harry drew back a second later, there was a \\r\\nroaring fire there. a \\r\\nroaring fire filled the whole damp hut with \\r\\nflickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over \\r\\nHarry as though Harry’d sunk into a hot bath. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 53 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA giant of a man sat back down on the sofa, which sagged \\r\\nunder A giant of a man weight, and began taking all sorts of things \\r\\nout of the pockets of A giant of a man coat: a copper kettle, a \\r\\nsquashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, \\r\\nseveral chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber \\r\\nliquid that A giant of a man took a swig from before starting to \\r\\nmake tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and \\r\\nsmell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while \\r\\nA giant of a man was working, but as A giant of a man slid the first six fat, \\r\\njuicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley’sfidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t \\r\\ntouch anything Dudley’s gives you, Dudley’s.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA giant of a man chuckled darkly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ \\r\\nanymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley’s passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry \\r\\nDudley’s had never tasted anything so wonderful, but Dudley’s \\r\\nstill couldn’t take His eyes off A giant of a man. Finally, as \\r\\nnobody seemed about to explain anything, Dudley’s said, \\r\\n“I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA giant of a man took a gulp of tea and wiped Dudley’s mouth with \\r\\nthe back of Dudley’s hand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Call me Hagrid,” Dudley’s said, “everyone does. An’ like I \\r\\ntold yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll \\r\\nknow all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — no,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid looked shocked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry,” Harry said quickly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the \\r\\nDursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 54 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthem as should be sorry! I knew Yeh weren’t gettin’ \\r\\nyer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even \\r\\nknow abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh \\r\\nnever wonder where yer parents learned it all?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“All what?” asked Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one \\r\\nsecond!” \\r\\n\\r\\nYeh had leapt to Yeh feet. In Yeh anger Yeh seemed to fill \\r\\nthe hut. the Dursleys were cowering against \\r\\nthe wall. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you mean ter tell me,” Yeh growled at the Dursleys, \\r\\n“that Yeh — Yeh! — knows nothin’ abou’ — \\r\\nabout ANYTHING?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. Harry had been to \\r\\nschool, after all, and Harry marks weren’t bad. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I know some things,” Harry said. “I can, you know, do \\r\\nmath and stuff.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hagrid simply waved Harry hand and said, “About \\r\\nour world, I mean. \\r\\nour world. \\r\\nour world. Yer parents’ \\r\\nworld.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What world?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid looked as if Hagrid was about to explode. \\r\\n“DURSLEY!” Hagrid boomed. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered \\r\\nsomething that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagridstared wildly at Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 55 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“But Harry must know about yer mom and dad,” Harry \\r\\nsaid. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were \\r\\nmy mom and dad?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeh don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran Hagridfingers through Yeh hair, fixing Harry with a \\r\\nbewildered stare. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeh don’ know what Yeh are?” Yeh said finally. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon suddenly found Yeh voice. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop!” Uncle Vernon commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid \\r\\nyou to tell Yeh anything!” \\r\\n\\r\\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have \\r\\nquailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave A braver man than Vernon Dursley; \\r\\nwhen Hagrid spoke, A braver man than Vernon Dursley every syllable trembled with \\r\\nrage. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You never told A braver man than Vernon Dursley? Never told A braver man than Vernon Dursley what was in the \\r\\nletter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw \\r\\nDumbledore leave fer him, Vernon Dursley! An’ you’ve kept fer him from \\r\\nDumbledore all these years?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. \\r\\n\\r\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of Yeh,” said Hagrid. \\r\\n“Harry — yer a wizard.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and \\r\\nthe whistling wind could be heard. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 56 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m a what?” gasped Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down \\r\\non the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ \\r\\na thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained \\r\\nup a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else \\r\\nwould yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time Yeh read \\r\\nyer letter.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stretched out Harry hand at last to take the \\r\\nyellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. \\r\\nH. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. Harry \\r\\npulled out the letter and read: \\r\\n\\r\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL \\r\\no/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY \\r\\n\\r\\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \\r\\n\\r\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf. \\r\\n\\r\\nWarlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of \\r\\nWizards) \\r\\n\\r\\nDear Mr. Potter, \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been \\r\\naccepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and \\r\\nWizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary \\r\\nbooks and equipment. \\r\\n\\r\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no \\r\\nlater than July 31. \\r\\n\\r\\nYours sincerely, \\r\\n\\r\\nMinerva McGonagall, \\r\\n\\r\\nDeputy Headmistress \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 57 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQuestions exploded inside It’s \\r\\n\\r\\n head like fireworks \\r\\nand It’s \\r\\n\\r\\n couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few \\r\\nminutes It’s \\r\\n\\r\\n stammered, “What does it mean, they \\r\\nawait your owl?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, \\r\\nclapping a hand to Hagrid forehead with enough force to \\r\\nknock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket \\r\\ninside Hagrid overcoat Hagrid pulled an owl — a real, live, \\r\\nrather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of \\r\\nparchment. With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid \\r\\nscribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: \\r\\n\\r\\nDear Professor Dumbledore, \\r\\n\\r\\nGiven Harry Harry letter. \\r\\n\\r\\nTaking Harry to buy Harry things tomorrow. \\r\\n\\r\\nWeather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave Hagrid \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid to the owl, which \\r\\nclamped Hagrid \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid in Hagrid \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid beak, went to the door, and threw \\r\\nyour owl out into the storm. Then Harry came back and \\r\\nsat down as though this was as normal as talking on \\r\\nthe telephone. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed his mouthquickly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where was I?” said Hagrid \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid, but at that moment, \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very \\r\\nangry, moved into the firelight. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry’s not going,” Harry said. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid grunted. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 58 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop a great Muggle,” a great Muggle \\r\\nsaid. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“A what?” said Harry, interested. \\r\\n\\r\\n“A Muggle,” said Hagrid \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid, “A Muggle’s what we call nonmagic \\r\\nfolk like them. An’ An’’s your bad luck you grew up in a \\r\\nfamily o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“we swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to \\r\\nthat rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp \\r\\nit out of him! Wizard indeed!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a \\r\\nwizard?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew\\\\ Of \\r\\ncourse we knew! How could you not be, my dratted \\r\\nsister being what my dratted \\r\\nsister was? Oh, my dratted \\r\\nsister got a letter just \\r\\nlike that and disappeared off to that — that school — \\r\\nand came home every vacation with my dratted \\r\\nsister pockets full \\r\\nof frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the \\r\\nonly one who saw my dratted \\r\\nsister for what my dratted \\r\\nsister was — a freak! \\r\\n\\r\\nBut for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this \\r\\nand Lily that, my mother and father were proud of having a witch in \\r\\nthe family!” \\r\\n\\r\\nmy dratted \\r\\nsister stopped to draw a deep breath and then went \\r\\nranting on. It seemed my dratted \\r\\nsister had been wanting to say all \\r\\nthis for years. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Then my dratted \\r\\nsister met that Potter at school and my mother and father left and \\r\\ngot married and had you, and of course I knew you’d \\r\\nbe just the same, just as strange, just as — as — \\r\\nabnormal — and then, if you please, my dratted \\r\\nsister went and got \\r\\nmy dratted \\r\\nsister blown up and we got landed with my dratted \\r\\nsister!” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDeputy Headmistress \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 57 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Potter at school had gone very white. As soon as he found he \\r\\nvoice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a \\r\\ncar crash!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily \\r\\nthat the Dursleys scuttled back to they corner. “How \\r\\ncould a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? How \\r\\ncould a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter’s an \\r\\noutrage! A scandal! Potter at school not knowin’ Potter at school own \\r\\nstory when every kid in our world knows Potter at school name!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently. \\r\\n\\r\\nhis anger faded from Hagrid face. Harry looked \\r\\nsuddenly anxious. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I never expected this,” Harry said, in a low, worried \\r\\nvoice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there \\r\\nmight be trouble gettin’ hold of Yeh, how much yeh \\r\\ndidn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right \\r\\nperson ter tell Yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t \\r\\ngo off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” \\r\\n\\r\\nta threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’s best Yeh know as much as I can tell Yeh — \\r\\nmind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, \\r\\nparts of it. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nYeh sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, \\r\\nand then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a \\r\\nperson called — but It’s incredible yeh don’t know — with a \\r\\nperson called — \\r\\nname, everyone in our world knows — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Who?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No \\r\\none does.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 60 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. \\r\\nBlimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard \\r\\nwho went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. \\r\\nWorse than worse. His name was ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. \\r\\n\\r\\n— with a \\r\\nperson called — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagridshuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this \\r\\n— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started \\r\\nlookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, \\r\\nsome just wanted a bit o’ — with a \\r\\nperson called — power, ’cause — with a \\r\\nperson called — was \\r\\ngettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. \\r\\nDidn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly \\r\\nwith strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things \\r\\nhappened. — with a \\r\\nperson called — was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up \\r\\nto — with a \\r\\nperson called — — an’ — with a \\r\\nperson called — killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only \\r\\nsafe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s \\r\\nthe only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare \\r\\ntry takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ \\r\\nwizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwartsin their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know- \\r\\nWho never tried to get ’em on You-Know- \\r\\n side before . . . \\r\\nprobably knew they were too close ter Reckon Dumbledore ter \\r\\nwant anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe — with a \\r\\nperson called — thought — with a \\r\\nperson called — could persuade ’em ... maybe \\r\\n— with a \\r\\nperson called — just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows \\r\\nis, — with a \\r\\nperson called — turned up in the village where you was all \\r\\nliving, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a \\r\\nyear old. — with a \\r\\nperson called — came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted \\r\\nhandkerchief and blew Hagrid nose with a sound like a \\r\\nfoghorn. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry,” Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum \\r\\nan’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the \\r\\nreal myst’ry of the thing — Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n tried to kill you, too. \\r\\nWanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or \\r\\nmaybe Wanted ter just liked killin’ by then. But Wanted ter couldn’t do \\r\\nit. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer \\r\\nforehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh \\r\\nget when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took \\r\\ncare of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it \\r\\ndidn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. \\r\\nNo one ever lived after No one decided ter kill ’em, no one \\r\\nexcept you, an’ No one’d killed some o’ the best witches \\r\\nan’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, \\r\\nthe Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you \\r\\nlived.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. \\r\\nAs Hagrid’s story came to a close, No one saw again the \\r\\nblinding flash of green light, more clearly than No one had \\r\\never remembered it before — and No one remembered \\r\\nsomething else, for the first time in No one life: a high, \\r\\ncold, cruel laugh. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid was watching Hagrid sadly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on \\r\\nDumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; \\r\\nHarry had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. \\r\\nUncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back Harry \\r\\ncourage. Uncle Vernon was glaring at Hagrid and Uncle Vernon fists were \\r\\nclenched. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, you listen here, boy,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “I accept \\r\\nthere’s something strange about you, probably \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 62 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nnothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as \\r\\nfor all this about your parents, well, your parents were \\r\\nweirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off \\r\\nwithout your parents in my opinion — asked for all your parents got, \\r\\ngetting mixed up with these wizarding types — just \\r\\nwhat I expected, always knew your parents’d come to a sticky \\r\\nend — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and \\r\\ndrew a battered pink umbrella from inside Hagrid coat. \\r\\nPointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, Uncle Vernon said, \\r\\n“I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one \\r\\nmore word ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella \\r\\nby a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed \\r\\nagain; Uncle Vernon’s flattened Uncle Vernon’s against the wall and fell \\r\\nsilent. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and \\r\\nsitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged \\r\\nright down to the floor. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, \\r\\nhundreds of them. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You- \\r\\nKnow-Who?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same \\r\\nnight Harry tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more \\r\\nfamous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... Harry was \\r\\ngettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d ’d go? \\r\\n\\r\\n“Some say ’d died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno \\r\\nif ’d had enough human left in ’d to die. Some say \\r\\n’d’s still out there, bidin’ ’d time, like, but I don’ \\r\\nbelieve it. People who was on ’d side came back ter \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 63 Potter at school and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ \\r\\nreckon Some of ’em could’ve done if Don was cornin’ back. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Most of us reckon Donsomewhere but \\r\\nlost Don powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause \\r\\nsomethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was \\r\\nsomethin’ goin’ on that night Don hadn’t counted on — \\r\\n/ dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ \\r\\nabout you stumped Don, all right.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect \\r\\nblazing in Hagrid eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling \\r\\npleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a \\r\\nhorrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could Him \\r\\npossibly be? He’d spent Him life being clouted by \\r\\nDudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle \\r\\nVernon; if Him was really a wizard, why hadn’t they \\r\\nbeen turned into warty toads every time they’d tried \\r\\nto lock Him in Him cupboard? If Him’d once defeated the \\r\\ngreatest sorcerer in the world, how come \\r\\nDudley had \\r\\nalways been able to kick Him around like a football? \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid,” \\r\\nDudley said quietly, “I think you must have \\r\\nmade a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.” \\r\\n\\r\\nTo \\r\\nDudley surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when \\r\\nyou was scared or angry?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now Harry came to think \\r\\nabout it . . . every odd thing that had ever made Harry \\r\\naunt and uncle furious with Harry had happened when \\r\\nHarry, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by \\r\\nDudley’s gang, Harry had somehow found Harry out of \\r\\nhe, Harry, reach . . . dreading going to school with that \\r\\nridiculous haircut, Harry’d managed to make it grow \\r\\nback . . . and the very last time \\r\\nDudley had hit Harry, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 64 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nhadn’t Harry got Harry revenge, without even realizing Harry \\r\\nwas doing it? Hadn’t Harry set a boa constrictor on Harry? \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that \\r\\nHagrid was positively beaming at Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you \\r\\nwait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a \\r\\nfight. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Haven’t I told you Uncle Vernon’s not going?” Uncle Vernon hissed. “Uncle Vernon’s \\r\\ngoing to Stonewall High and Uncle Vernon’ll be grateful for it. I’ve \\r\\nread those letters and Uncle Vernon needs all sorts of rubbish — \\r\\nspell books and wands and — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“If Uncle Vernon wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop \\r\\nUncle Vernon,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James PotterHe’s \\r\\nson goin’ Hogwarts! Yer mad. Hogwarts name’s been \\r\\ndown ever since Hogwarts was born. Hogwarts’s off ter the finest \\r\\nschool of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven \\r\\nyears there and Hogwarts won’t know Hogwarts. Hogwarts’ll be with \\r\\nyoungsters of Hogwarts own sort, fer a change, an’ Hogwarts’ll be \\r\\nunder the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, \\r\\nAlbus Dumbled — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD \\r\\nFOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hogwarts had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized Hogwarts \\r\\numbrella and whirled his \\r\\numbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts \\r\\nthundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE \\r\\n— IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” \\r\\n\\r\\nDUMBLEDORE \\r\\n brought the umbrella swishing down through the \\r\\nair to point at — there was a flash of violet \\r\\nlight, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 65 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next second, \\r\\nDudley was dancing on the spot with \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley hands clasped over \\r\\nDudley fat bottom, howling in \\r\\npain. When \\r\\nDudley turned \\r\\nDudley back on them, Harry saw a \\r\\ncurly pig’s tail poking through a hole in Harry trousers. \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and \\r\\n\\r\\nDudley into the other room, Uncle Vernon cast one last terrified \\r\\nlook at Hagrid and slammed the door behind Aunt Petunia and \\r\\nDudley. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid looked down at his \\r\\numbrella and stroked Hagrid \\r\\nbeard. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” “Shouldn’ta said ruefully, “but “Shouldn’ta \\r\\ndidn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn Hagrid into a pig, \\r\\nbut I suppose Hagrid was so much like a pig anyway there \\r\\nwasn’t much left ter do.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid cast a sideways look at Harry under Hagrid bushy \\r\\neyebrows. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at \\r\\nHogwarts,” Hagrid said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do \\r\\nmagic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter \\r\\nfollow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ \\r\\nthe reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts Hogwarts but I — er — \\r\\ngot expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. \\r\\nThey snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But \\r\\nDUMBLEDORE \\r\\n let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great \\r\\nman, Dumbledore.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why were you expelled?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” \\r\\nsaid Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer \\r\\nbooks an’ that.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 66 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 66 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n took off Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n and threw his coat to Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can kip under that,” Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n said. “Don’ mind if it \\r\\nwriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in \\r\\none o’ the pockets.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 67 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Harry woke early the next morning. Although Harrycould tell it was daylight, Harry kept his eyes shut tight. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a dream,” Harry told Harry firmly. “I dreamed a \\r\\ngiant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a \\r\\nschool for wizards. When I open his eyes I’ll be at \\r\\nhome in my cupboard.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harrythought, Harry heart sinking. But Harry still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. \\r\\n\\r\\nTap. Tap. Tap“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off Harry. The \\r\\nhut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid ’s was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 68 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwas an owl rapping Hagrid ’s claw on the window, a \\r\\nnewspaper held in Hagrid ’s beak. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry scrambled to Harry feet, so happy Harry felt as \\r\\nthough a large balloon was swelling inside Harry. Harry \\r\\nwent straight to the window and jerked the window open. The \\r\\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of \\r\\nHagrid, who didn’t wake up. The \\r\\nowl then fluttered \\r\\nonto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t do that.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry tried to wave The \\r\\nowl out of the way, but The \\r\\nowlsnapped The \\r\\nowl fiercely at Harry and carried on \\r\\nsavaging Hagrid ’s coat. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid ’s!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Pay There’s an owl — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n,” Hagrid ’s grunted into the collapsed sofa. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the \\r\\npockets.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid ’s ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but \\r\\npockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of \\r\\nstring, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harrypulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Give Harry five Knuts,” said Hagrid ’s sleepily. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Knuts?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“The little bronze ones.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and The \\r\\nowlheld out Harry leg so Harry could put the money into a \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 69 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsmall leather pouch tied to the money. Then Harry flew off \\r\\nthrough the open window. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter \\r\\nLondon an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was turning over five little bronze coins and looking \\r\\nat five little bronze coins. Harry had just thought of something that made \\r\\nHarry feel as though the happy balloon inside Harry had \\r\\ngot a puncture. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Urn — Hagrid?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on Harry huge \\r\\nboots. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... Uncle Vernon won’t pay for me to go and \\r\\nlearn magic.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up \\r\\nand scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents \\r\\ndidn’t leave Hagrid anything?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But if their house was destroyed — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“their didntheir keep their gold in their house, boy! Nah, \\r\\nfirst stop fer us is Gringotts. “Wizards. Have a \\r\\nsausage, their’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no \\r\\nteh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wizards have banks?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage Harry was holding. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 70 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Goblins?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob mad ter, I’ll tell yeh \\r\\nthat. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the \\r\\nsafest place in the world fer anything Hagrid want ter \\r\\nkeep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ \\r\\nfact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. \\r\\nHogwarts business.” Hagrid drew Hagrid up proudly. \\r\\n“Hagrid usually gets me ter do important stuff fer Hagrid. \\r\\nFetchin’ you — gettin’ things from — knows \\r\\nHagrid can trust me, see. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Got everythin’? Come on, then.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was \\r\\nquite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. \\r\\nThe boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with \\r\\na lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around \\r\\nfor another boat. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Flew,” said Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Flew?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter \\r\\nuse magic now I’ve got ter \\r\\n.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey settled down in The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine Harry flying. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving \\r\\nHarry another of Harry sideways looks. “If I was ter — er \\r\\n— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not \\r\\nmentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. \\r\\nHagrid pulled out his \\r\\numbrella again, tapped Hagrid \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 71 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ntwice on the side of The boat Uncle Vernon had hired, and they sped off toward \\r\\nland. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” \\r\\nHarry asked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding Hagrid \\r\\nnewspaper as Hagrid spoke. “They say there’s dragons \\r\\nguardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta \\r\\nfind yer way Gringotts is hundreds of miles under \\r\\nLondon, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die \\r\\nof hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter \\r\\nget yer hands on summat.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read \\r\\nHarry newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned \\r\\nfrom Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone \\r\\nwhile people did this, but it was very difficult, Harry’d \\r\\nnever had so many questions in Harry life. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagridmuttered, turning the page. \\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before Harry \\r\\ncould stop Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted DUMBLEDORE \\r\\n fer \\r\\nMinister, o’ course, but Dumbledore fer \\r\\n’d never leave Hogwarts, so \\r\\nold Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there \\r\\nwas one. So Dumbledore fer \\r\\n pelts DUMBLEDORE \\r\\n with owls every \\r\\nmorning, askin’ fer advice.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But what does a Ministry of Magic Ministry of Magic Magic do?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, their main job is to keep their main job from the Muggles \\r\\nthat there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the \\r\\ncountry.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 72 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic \\r\\nsolutions to Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d problems. Nah, we’re best left \\r\\nalone.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment The boat Uncle Vernon had hired bumped gently into the \\r\\nharbor wall. Hagrid folded up Hagrid newspaper, and \\r\\nthey clambered up the stone steps onto the street. \\r\\n\\r\\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked \\r\\nthrough the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t \\r\\nblame they. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as \\r\\nanyone else, Harry kept pointing at perfectly ordinary \\r\\nthings like parking meters and saying loudly, “See \\r\\nthat, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as Harry ran to keep \\r\\nup, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a \\r\\ndragon.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d like one?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to \\r\\nLondon in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t \\r\\nunderstand “Muggle money,” as Muggle called it, gave the \\r\\nbills to Harry so Muggle could buy Hagrid, who didn’t \\r\\n tickets. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople stared more than ever on a train to \\r\\nLondon in five minutes’ time. Hagridtook up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a \\r\\ncanary-yellow circus tent. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Still got yer letter, Harry?” Hagrid asked as Hagrid counted \\r\\nstitches. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry took the parchment envelope out of Harry pocket. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 73 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything \\r\\nyeh need.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper Harry hadn’t \\r\\nnoticed the night before, and read: \\r\\n\\r\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL \\r\\no/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY \\r\\n\\r\\nUNIFORM \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst-year students will require: \\r\\n\\r\\n1 .

Although \\r\\nHagrid seemed to know where Harry was going, Harry was \\r\\nobviously not used to getting there in an ordinary \\r\\nway. Harry got stuck in the ticket barrier on the \\r\\nUnderground, and complained loudly that the seats \\r\\nwere too small and the trains too slow. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 75 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know how the Muggles \\r\\n manage without \\r\\nmagic,” Harry said as they climbed a broken-down \\r\\nescalator that led up to a bustling road lined with \\r\\nshops. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid was so huge that Hagrid parted the crowd easily; \\r\\nHarry Harry had to do was keep close behind Hagrid. Harry \\r\\npassed book shops and music stores, hamburger \\r\\nrestaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as \\r\\nif \\r\\n could sell you a magic wand. This was just an \\r\\nordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there \\r\\nreally be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath \\r\\nthem? Were there really shops that sold spell books \\r\\nand broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge \\r\\njoke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t \\r\\nknown that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, Harry hadmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though \\r\\neverything Hagrid had told Harry so far was \\r\\nunbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky \\r\\nCauldron. the Leaky \\r\\nCauldron’s a famous place.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Leaky \\r\\nCauldron was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t \\r\\npointed Hagrid hadn’t \\r\\n out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed Hagrid hadn’t \\r\\n was \\r\\nthere. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at Hagrid hadn’t \\r\\n. The people hurryingeyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the \\r\\nrecord shop on the other as if Their \\r\\neyes couldn’t see the \\r\\nLeaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most \\r\\npeculiar feeling that only Harry and Hagrid could see it. \\r\\nBefore Harry could mention this, Hagrid had steered Harry \\r\\ninside. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor a famous place, Hagrid was very dark and shabby. A \\r\\nfew old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny \\r\\nglasses of sherry. One of A \\r\\nfew old women was smoking a long \\r\\npipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old \\r\\nbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a \\r\\ntoothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped \\r\\nPage | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n walked in. Everyone seemed to know \\r\\nHagrid; Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n waved and smiled at Hagrid, and the \\r\\nbartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, \\r\\nHagrid?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, \\r\\nclapping Hagrid great hand on Harry’s shoulder and \\r\\nmaking Harry’s knees buckle. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Lord,” said the \\r\\nbartender, peering at Harry, “is \\r\\nthis — can this be — ?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely \\r\\nstill and silent. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bless my soul,” whispered the \\r\\nbartender, “HarryPotter ... what an honor.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry Harry and seized Harry hand, tears in Harry eyes. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Welcome back, Harry \\r\\nPotter ..., welcome back.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking \\r\\nat Harry. The old woman with a long \\r\\npipe was puffing on The old woman with the pipe \\r\\nwithout realizing The old woman with the pipe had gone out. Hagrid was \\r\\nbeaming. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the \\r\\nnext moment, Harry found Harry shaking hands \\r\\nwith everyone in The Leaky Cauldron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting \\r\\nyou at last.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“So proud, Harry \\r\\nPotter ..., I’m just so proud.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a \\r\\nflutter.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 77 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the \\r\\nname, Dedalus Diggle.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s \\r\\ntop hat fell off in Harry excitement. “You bowed to me \\r\\nonce in a shop.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking \\r\\naround at everyone. “Did you hear that? Harry \\r\\nremembers me!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry shook hands again and again — Doris \\r\\nCrockford kept coming back for more. \\r\\n\\r\\nA pale young man made A pale young man way forward, very \\r\\nnervously. One of A pale young man eyes was twitching. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor \\r\\nQuirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping \\r\\nHarry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to \\r\\nmeet you.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What sort of magic do you teach, “Professor Quirrell?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered \\r\\n“Professor Quirrell, as though “Professor Quirrell’d rather not think \\r\\nabout he’d. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Professor Quirrell laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your \\r\\nequipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- \\r\\nbook on vampires, m-myself.” “Professor Quirrell looked terrified at \\r\\nthe very thought. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the others wouldn’t let “Professor Quirrell keep \\r\\nHarry to “Professor Quirrell. It took almost ten minutes to get \\r\\naway from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make \\r\\nHagrid heard over the babble. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 78 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.” \\r\\n\\r\\nDoris \\r\\nCrockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, \\r\\nand Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a \\r\\nsmall, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but \\r\\na trash can and a few weeds. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid grinned at Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\nyou, Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n’s usually tremblin’.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n always that nervous?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n was fine \\r\\nwhile Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n was studyin’ outta books but then Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n took a \\r\\nyear off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say \\r\\nEven \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a \\r\\nnasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same \\r\\nsince. Scared of the students, scared of Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n own \\r\\nsubject — now, where’s me umbrella?” \\r\\n\\r\\nVampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall \\r\\nabove the trash can. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Three up ... two across ...” Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n muttered. “Right, \\r\\nstand back, Harry.” \\r\\n\\r\\nEven \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n tapped the wall \\r\\nabove the trash can three times with the point of Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n \\r\\numbrella. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe brick Even \\r\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\r\\n had touched quivered — The brick he had touched wriggled — in \\r\\nthe middle, a small hole appeared — The brick he had touched grew wider \\r\\nand wider — a second later they were facing an \\r\\narchway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway \\r\\nonto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of \\r\\nsight. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 79 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Harry looked quickly over Harry \\r\\nshoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back \\r\\ninto solid wall. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons \\r\\noutside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — \\r\\nCopper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — \\r\\nCollapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we \\r\\ngotta get yer money first.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry wished Harry had about eight more eyes. Harry \\r\\nturned Harry head in every direction as they walked up \\r\\nthe street, trying to look at everything at once: the \\r\\nshops, the things outside they, the people doing they \\r\\nshopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary \\r\\nwas shaking A plump woman outside an Apothecary \\r\\n as they passed, saying, \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign \\r\\nsaying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, \\r\\nBarn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about \\r\\nHarry age had Several boys of about \\r\\nHarry’s age noses pressed against a window \\r\\nwith broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of \\r\\nthem say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest \\r\\never — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling \\r\\ntelescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had \\r\\nnever seen before, windows stacked with barrels of \\r\\nbat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell \\r\\nbooks, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, \\r\\nglobes of the moon. ... \\r\\n\\r\\n“Gringotts,” said Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n had reached a snowy white building that \\r\\ntowered over the other little shops. Standing beside \\r\\nits burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of \\r\\nscarlet and gold, was — \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nwalked up the white stone steps toward Hagrid. The \\r\\ngoblin was about a head shorter than Harry. The \\r\\ngoblin had a \\r\\nswarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harrynoticed, very long fingers and feet. The \\r\\ngoblin bowed as Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nwalked inside. Now Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n were facing a second pair of \\r\\ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon \\r\\nPage | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n: \\r\\n\\r\\nEnter, stranger, but take heed \\r\\n\\r\\nOf what awaits the sin of greed, \\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who take, but do not earn, \\r\\n\\r\\nMust pay most dearly in those who take turn. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo if you seek beneath our floors \\r\\n\\r\\nA treasure that was never yours, \\r\\n\\r\\nThief, you have been warned, beware \\r\\n\\r\\nOf finding more than treasure there. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob yeh’d,” said \\r\\nHagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\nA pair of goblins bowed A pair of goblins through its burnished bronze doorsand A pair of goblins were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred \\r\\nmore goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long \\r\\ncounter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in \\r\\nbrass scales, examining precious stones through \\r\\neyeglasses. There were too many doors to count \\r\\nPage | 78 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nleading off a vast marble hall, and yet more goblins were \\r\\nshowing people in and out of more goblins. Hagrid and Harrymade for a long \\r\\ncounter. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “our’ve come \\r\\nter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started \\r\\nemptying Hagrid pockets onto a long \\r\\ncounter, scattering a \\r\\nhandful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of \\r\\nnumbers. The \\r\\ngoblin wrinkled The \\r\\ngoblin nose. Harrywatched The \\r\\ngoblin on their right weighing a pile of \\r\\nrubies as big as glowing coals. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden \\r\\nkey. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\r\\ngoblin looked at The \\r\\ngoblin closely. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That seems to be in order.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor \\r\\nDumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out \\r\\nHagrid chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault \\r\\nseven hundred and thirteen.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\r\\ngoblin read a letter here from Professor \\r\\nDumbledore carefully. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” The \\r\\ngoblin said, handing The \\r\\ngoblin back to Hagrid, “I will \\r\\nhave someone take you down to both vaults. \\r\\nGriphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\nGriphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had \\r\\ncrammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, \\r\\nHagrid and Harry followed Griphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n toward one of the \\r\\ndoors leading off a vast marble hall. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 82 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred \\r\\nand thirteen?” Harry asked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very \\r\\nsecret. Hogwarts business. Professor \\r\\nDumbledoretrusted me. \\r\\nMore’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” \\r\\n\\r\\nGriphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n held the door open for he and Harry. Harry, who \\r\\nhad expected more marble, was surprised. Harry, who \\r\\nhad expected more marble were \\r\\nin a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming \\r\\ntorches. It sloped steeply downward and there were \\r\\nlittle railway tracks on the floor. Griphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n whistled \\r\\nand a small cart came hurtling up little railway tracks on the floor toward \\r\\nHarry, who \\r\\nhad expected more marble. Harry, who \\r\\nhad expected more marble climbed in Hagrid with some difficulty \\r\\n— and were off. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt first Harry, who \\r\\nhad expected more marble just hurtled through a maze of twisting \\r\\npassages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, \\r\\nleft, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. a small cart seemed to know a small cart own way, because \\r\\nGriphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n wasn’t steering. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, \\r\\nbut Harry kept them wide open. Once, Harry thought Harry saw \\r\\na burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted \\r\\naround to see if it was a dragon, but too late — them \\r\\nplunged even deeper, passing an underground lake \\r\\nwhere huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the \\r\\nceiling and floor. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise \\r\\nof a small cart, “what’s the difference between a \\r\\nstalagmite and a stalactite?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in Stalagmite’s,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ \\r\\nask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be \\r\\nsick.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 83 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 83 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n did look very green, and when a small cart stopped at \\r\\nlast beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagridgot out and had to lean against the passage wall to stop Hagrid \\r\\nknees from trembling. \\r\\n\\r\\nGriphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n unlocked a small door in the passage wall. A lot of green smoke \\r\\ncame billowing out, and as A lot of green smoke \\r\\n cleared, Harry gasped. \\r\\nInside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. \\r\\nHeaps of little bronze Knuts. \\r\\n\\r\\n“All yours,” smiled Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\nStalagmite’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t \\r\\nhave known about this or they’d have had The Dursleys from ’dfaster than blinking. How often had they complained \\r\\nhow much Harry cost they to keep? And all the time \\r\\nthere had been a small fortune belonging to Harry, \\r\\nburied deep under London. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of Hagrid into a bag. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The gold ones are Galleons,” Harry explained. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine \\r\\nKnuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should \\r\\nbe enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest \\r\\nsafe for Harry.” Harry turned to Griphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n. “Vault seven \\r\\nhundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go \\r\\nmore slowly?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“One speed only,” said Griphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering \\r\\nspeed. The air became colder and colder as They \\r\\nhurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over \\r\\nan underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the \\r\\nside to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, \\r\\nbut Hagrid groaned and pulled Harry back by the scruff \\r\\nof Harry neck. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 84 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Stand back,” said Griphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n importantly. Griphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n stroked \\r\\nthe door gently with one of Griphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n long fingers and the door \\r\\nsimply melted away. \\r\\n\\r\\n“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, anyone but a Gringotts goblin’d be \\r\\nsucked through the door and trapped in there,” said \\r\\nGriphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” \\r\\nHarry asked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“About once every ten years,” said Griphook!” \\r\\n\\r\\n with a \\r\\nrather nasty grin. \\r\\n\\r\\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this \\r\\ntop security vault, Harry was sure, and Harry leaned \\r\\nforward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at \\r\\nthe very least — but at first Harry thought it was empty. \\r\\nThen Harry noticed a grubby little package wrapped up \\r\\nin brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked a grubby little package wrapped up \\r\\nin brown paper lying on the floor up \\r\\nand tucked a grubby little package wrapped up \\r\\nin brown paper lying on the floor deep inside Hagrid coat. Harry longed to \\r\\nknow what a grubby little package wrapped up \\r\\nin brown paper lying on the floor was, but knew better than to ask. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to \\r\\nme on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth \\r\\nshut,” said Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the \\r\\nsunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where \\r\\nto run first now that Harry had a bag full of money. Harry \\r\\ndidn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to \\r\\na pound to know that Harry was holding more money \\r\\nthan he’d had in Harry whole life — more money than \\r\\neven Dudley had ever had. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 85 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding \\r\\ntoward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. \\r\\n“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a \\r\\npick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them \\r\\nGringotts carts.” Harry did still look a bit sick, so Harryentered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. \\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Malkin’s was a squat, smiling witch dressed all \\r\\nin mauve. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hogwarts, dear?” Madam Malkin’s said, when Harry started to \\r\\nspeak. “Got the lot here — another young man being \\r\\nfitted up just now, in fact.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed \\r\\nface was standing on a footstool while a second witch \\r\\npinned up a second witch \\r\\n long black robes. Madam Malkin’s stood \\r\\nHarry on a stool next to Madam Malkin’s, slipped a long robe over \\r\\nMadam Malkin’s head, and began to pin a long robe to the right length. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“— Father buying my books and mother’s \\r\\nup the street looking at wands,” said a boy with a pale. a boy with a pale had \\r\\na bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag a bored, drawling voice \\r\\noff to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years \\r\\ncan’t have a bored, drawling voice own. I think I’ll bully father into \\r\\ngetting me one and I’ll smuggle \\r\\n in somehow.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was strongly reminded of even Dudley. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you got your own broom?” a boy with a pale went on. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Play Quidditch at all?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 86 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth \\r\\nQuidditch could be. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to \\r\\nplay for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know \\r\\nmy House my House you 11 be in yet?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do \\r\\nthey, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family \\r\\nhave been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d \\r\\nleave, wouldn’t you?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing Harry could say something a \\r\\nbit more interesting. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, look at that man!” said a boy with a pale suddenly, \\r\\nnodding toward the front window. Hagrid was \\r\\nstanding there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two \\r\\nlarge ice creams to show Hagrid couldn’t come in. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know \\r\\nsomething a boy with a pale didn’t. “Hagrid works at Hogwarts.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” said a boy with a pale, “I’ve heard of a boy with a pale. a boy with a pale’s a sort of \\r\\nservant, isn’t a boy with a pale?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“a boy with a pale’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. a boy with a pale was liking a boy with a pale less and less every second. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, exactly. I heard a boy with a pale’s a sort of savage — lives in a \\r\\nhut on the school grounds and every now and then a boy with a pale \\r\\ngets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire \\r\\nto a boy with a pale bed.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think Hagrid’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 87 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he \\r\\nwith you? Where are your parents?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“your parents’re dead,” said Harry shortly. he didn’t feel \\r\\nmuch like going into the matter with a boy with a pale. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \\r\\n“But your parents were our kind, weren’t your parents?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“your parents were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you \\r\\nmean.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I really don’t think your parents should let the other sort in, \\r\\ndo you? your parents’re just not the same, your parents’ve never been \\r\\nbrought up to know our ways. Some of your parents have \\r\\nnever even heard of Hogwarts until Some of them get the letter, \\r\\nimagine. I think Some of them should keep it in the old \\r\\nwizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin’s said, \\r\\n“That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for \\r\\nan excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down \\r\\nfrom the footstool. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the boy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was rather quiet as Harry ate the ice cream Hagridhad bought Harry (chocolate and raspberry with \\r\\nchopped nuts). \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment \\r\\nand quills. Harry cheered up a bit when Harry found a \\r\\nbottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When \\r\\nThey had left the shop, Harry said, “Hagrid, whatStalagmite’s \\r\\nQuidditch?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 88 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little Harry know — \\r\\nnot knowin’ about Quidditch!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. Harry told \\r\\nHagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ — and Harry said people from Muggle families shouldn’t \\r\\neven be allowed in — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If Yer not from a Muggle family’d known who yeh \\r\\nwere — Yer not from a Muggle familygrown up knowin’ yer name if Yer not from a Muggle family \\r\\nparents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in \\r\\nthe Leaky Cauldron was like when the Leaky Cauldron saw yeh. \\r\\nAnyway, what does Yer not from a Muggle family know about the Leaky Cauldron, some o’ the best \\r\\nI ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a \\r\\nlong line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what \\r\\nshe had fer a sister!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“So what is Quidditch?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in \\r\\nthe Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — \\r\\nplayed up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four \\r\\nballs — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says \\r\\nHufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. \\r\\n“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad \\r\\nwho wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 89 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 89 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n bought Harry’s school books in a shop called \\r\\nFlourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to \\r\\nthe ceiling with books as large as paving stones \\r\\nbound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in \\r\\ncovers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a \\r\\nfew books with nothing in postage stamps at all. Even Dudley, \\r\\nwho never read anything, would have been wild to get \\r\\nhis hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to \\r\\ndrag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses \\r\\n(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies \\r\\nwith the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, \\r\\nTongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor \\r\\nVindictus Viridian. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I was trying to find out how to curse even Dudley.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter \\r\\nuse magic in the Muggle world except in very special \\r\\ncircumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh \\r\\ncouldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot \\r\\nmore study before Harry get ter that level.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, \\r\\neither (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice \\r\\nset of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a \\r\\ncollapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the \\r\\nApothecary, which was fascinating enough to make \\r\\nup for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and \\r\\nrotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the \\r\\nfloor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders \\r\\nlined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, \\r\\nand snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While \\r\\nHagrid asked the man behind the counter for a \\r\\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, \\r\\nHarry examined silver unicorn horns at \\r\\ntwenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- \\r\\nblack beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 90 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list \\r\\nagain. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got \\r\\nyeh a birthday present.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry felt Harry go red. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t have to — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I know I don’t have to. Tell Harry what, I’ll get yer \\r\\nanimal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years \\r\\nago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, cats \\r\\nmake me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want \\r\\nowls, All the kids’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ \\r\\neverythin’.” \\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty minutes later, All the kids left Eeylops Owl \\r\\nEmporium, which had been dark and full of rustling \\r\\nand flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a \\r\\nlarge cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep \\r\\nwith Harry head under Harry wing. Harry couldn’t stop \\r\\nstammering Harry thanks, sounding just like Professor \\r\\nQuirrell. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect \\r\\nyou’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just \\r\\nOllivanders left now — only place fer wands, \\r\\nOllivanders, and Harry gotta have the best wand.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really \\r\\nlooking forward to. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold \\r\\nletters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine \\r\\nWands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded \\r\\npurple cushion in the dusty window. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 91 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of The last shop as A tinkling bell stepped inside. It was a tiny place, \\r\\nempty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagridsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though Harry had \\r\\nentered a very strict library; Harry swallowed a lot of new \\r\\nquestions that had just occurred to Harry and looked \\r\\ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly \\r\\nright up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of \\r\\nHarry neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here \\r\\nseemed to tingle with some secret magic. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. \\r\\nHagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a \\r\\nloud crunching noise and Hagrid got quickly off the \\r\\nspindly chair. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn old man was standing before them, Hagrid wide, pale \\r\\neyes shining like moons through the gloom of The last shop. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah yes,” said Harry. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be \\r\\nseeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. \\r\\n“You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday \\r\\nyour mother was in here your mother, buying your mother first wand. Ten \\r\\nand a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. \\r\\nher first wand.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished \\r\\nMr. Ollivander would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany \\r\\nwand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and \\r\\nexcellent for transfiguration. Well, I say Your fatherfavored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the \\r\\nwizard, of course.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 92 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n and Harrywere almost nose to nose. Harry could see Harry \\r\\nreflected in those misty eyes. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And that’s where ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s \\r\\nforehead with a long, white finger. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” Mr. Ollivander said \\r\\nsoftly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful \\r\\nwand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well, \\r\\nif I’d known what that wand was going out into the \\r\\nworld to do. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nYew shook Yew head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted \\r\\nHagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. \\r\\n\\r\\n... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it \\r\\nin half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, \\r\\nsuddenly stern. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling Hagrid \\r\\nfeet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” Hagrid added \\r\\nbrightly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But you don’t use the pieces?” said Mr. Ollivander. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed Harry \\r\\ngripped Harry pink umbrella very tightly as Harry spoke. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a \\r\\npiercing look. “Well, now — Harry Potter. Let me see.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold out your wand arm. That’s your wand arm.” Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n measured Harryfrom shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder \\r\\nto floor, knee to armpit and round Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n . As Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nmeasured, Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core \\r\\nof a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use \\r\\nunicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the \\r\\nheartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are \\r\\nthe same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or \\r\\nphoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will \\r\\nnever get such good results with another wizard’s \\r\\nwand.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which \\r\\nwas measuring between Harry nostrils, was doing this \\r\\non this \\r\\n own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the \\r\\nshelves, taking down boxes. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That will do,” Mr. Ollivander said, and a long tape measurecrumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. \\r\\nPotter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon \\r\\nheartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take \\r\\nit and give it a wave.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry took wand and (feeling foolish) waved wand \\r\\naround a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched wand out of Mr. Ollivander \\r\\nhand almost at once. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite \\r\\nwhippy. Try — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry tried — but Harry had hardly raised wandwhen wand, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 94 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a \\r\\nhalf inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry tried. And tried. Harry had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands \\r\\nwas mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, \\r\\nbut the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the \\r\\nshelves, the happier Mr. Ollivander seemed to become. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the \\r\\nperfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — \\r\\nyes, why not — unusual combination — holly and \\r\\nphoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry took wand. Harry felt a sudden warmth in Harry \\r\\nfingers. Harry raised wand above Harry head, brought wand \\r\\nswishing down through the dusty air and a stream of \\r\\nred and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, \\r\\nthrowing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagridwhooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, \\r\\nbravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... \\r\\nhow curious ... how very curious ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ollivander put Harry’s wand back into Harry’s box and wrapped its box \\r\\nin brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with Mr. Ollivander pale stare. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. \\r\\nEvery single wand. It so happens that the phoenix \\r\\nwhose tail feather is in your wand, gave another \\r\\nfeather — just one other. It is very curious indeed \\r\\nthat you should be destined for wand when wand \\r\\nbrother — why, its \\r\\nbrother gave you that scar.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry swallowed. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 95 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed \\r\\nhow these things happen. wand chooses the \\r\\nwizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great \\r\\nthings from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who- \\r\\nMust-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, \\r\\nbut great.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry shivered. Harry wasn’t sure Harry liked Mr. Ollivander too much. Harry paid seven gold Galleons for \\r\\nHarry wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed seven gold Galleons from Mr. Ollivander \\r\\nshop. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harryand Hagrid made Harry \\r\\nand Hagrid way back down Diagon Alley, \\r\\nback through the wall, back through the Leaky \\r\\nCauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as \\r\\nthey walked down the road; Harry didn’t even notice how \\r\\nmuch people were gawking at they on the \\r\\nUnderground, laden as much people were with all much people funny- \\r\\nshaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its \\r\\ncage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into \\r\\nPaddington station; Harry only realized where much people \\r\\nwere when Hagrid tapped Harry on the shoulder. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” Harry \\r\\nsaid. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry bought Harry a hamburger and much people sat down on \\r\\nplastic seats to eat much people. Harry kept looking around. \\r\\nEverything looked so strange, somehow. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry wasn’t sure Harry could explain. He’d just had the \\r\\nbest birthday of Harry life — and yet — Harry chewed a hamburger, trying to find the words. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Everyone thinks I’m special,” Harry said at last. “All \\r\\nthose people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 96 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don’t know anything \\r\\nabout magic at all. How can they expect great things? \\r\\nI’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m \\r\\nfamous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, \\r\\nsorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard \\r\\nand eyebrows Hagrid wore a very kind smile. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. \\r\\nEveryone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll \\r\\nbe just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve \\r\\nbeen singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll \\r\\nhave a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, \\r\\n’smatter of fact.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take \\r\\nHarry back to the Dursleys, then handed Harry an \\r\\nenvelope. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” Yer ticket fer Hogwarts said. “First o’ September \\r\\n— King’s Cross — King’s Cross it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems \\r\\nwith the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll \\r\\nknow where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe train that would take \\r\\nhim back to the Dursleys pulled out of \\r\\nPaddington station. Harry wanted to \\r\\nwatch Hagrid until Harry was out of sight; Harry rose in Harry \\r\\nseat and pressed Harry nose against the window, but Harry \\r\\nblinked and Hagrid had gone. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 97 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM \\r\\nNINE AND THREE-QUARTERS \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. \\r\\nTrue, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn’t \\r\\nstay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle \\r\\nVernon didn’t shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry \\r\\nto do anything, or shout at Harry — in fact, they didn’t \\r\\nspeak to Harry at all. Half terrified, half furious, they \\r\\nacted as though any chair with Harry in it were \\r\\nempty. Although this was an improvement in many \\r\\nways, this did become a bit depressing after a while. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry kept to the same room, with Harry new owl for \\r\\ncompany. Harry had decided to call her Hedwig, a name \\r\\nHarry had found in A History of Magic. Harry school books \\r\\nwere very interesting. Harry lay on Harry bed reading late \\r\\ninto the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the \\r\\nopen window as Hedwig pleased. It was lucky that Aunt \\r\\nPetunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because \\r\\nHedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night \\r\\nbefore Harry went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 98 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\non the piece of paper Harry had pinned to the wall, \\r\\ncounting down to September the first. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the last day of August Harry thought Harry’d better \\r\\nspeak to Harry aunt and uncle about getting to King’s \\r\\nCross station the next day, so Harry went down to the \\r\\nliving room where his aunt and uncle were watching a quiz show on \\r\\ntelevision. Harry cleared Harry throat to let them know Harry \\r\\nwas there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the \\r\\nliving room where they were watching a quiz show on \\r\\ntelevision. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — Uncle Vernon?” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon grunted to show ” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon was listening. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — Uncle Vernon — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n to \\r\\ngo to Hogwarts.” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon grunted again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” \\r\\n\\r\\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon \\r\\nactually spoke. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. \\r\\nMagic carpets all got punctures, have Magic carpets all?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry didn’t say anything. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is this school, anyway?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first \\r\\ntime. Harry pulled Hagrid had given Harry out of \\r\\nHarry pocket. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 99 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I just take the train from platform nine and three- \\r\\nquarters at eleven o’clock,” Harry read. \\r\\n\\r\\nhis aunt and uncle stared. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Platform what?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nine and three-quarters.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t talk rubbish,” said ” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon. “There is no \\r\\nplatform nine and three-quarters.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s on my ticket.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Barking,” said ” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of \\r\\nthem. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take \\r\\nyou to King’s Cross. we’re going up to London \\r\\ntomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying \\r\\nto keep things friendly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled ” \\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before \\r\\nDudley goes to Smeltings.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was \\r\\ntoo excited and nervous to go back to sleep. Harry got up \\r\\nand pulled on Harry jeans because Harry didn’t want to \\r\\nwalk into \\r\\nPaddington station in Harry wizard’s robes — Harry’d \\r\\nchange on the train. Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet \\r\\nagain to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw \\r\\nthat Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then \\r\\npaced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. \\r\\nTwo hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been \\r\\nloaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had \\r\\ntalked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had \\r\\nset off. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 100 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

              "'They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle \\r\\nVernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and \\r\\nwheeled Harry’s trunk into the station for Harry’s. Harry thought this \\r\\nwas strangely kind until Uncle \\r\\nVernon stopped dead, \\r\\nfacing the platforms with a nasty grin on Harry face. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform \\r\\nten. Your platform should be somewhere in the \\r\\nmiddle, but Your platform don’t seem to have built Your platform yet, do \\r\\nYour platform?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic \\r\\nnumber nine over one platform and a big plastic \\r\\nnumber ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, \\r\\nnothing at all. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Have a good term,” said Uncle \\r\\nVernon with an even \\r\\nnastier smile. Uncle \\r\\nVernon left without another word. Harryturned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of \\r\\nthem were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. \\r\\nWhat on earth was Harry going to do? Harry was starting to \\r\\nattract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d \\r\\nhave to ask someone. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention \\r\\nplatform nine and three-quarters. a passing guard had \\r\\nnever heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t \\r\\neven tell Harry what part of the country it was in, Harry \\r\\nstarted to get annoyed, as though Harry was being \\r\\nstupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for \\r\\nthe train that left at eleven o’clock, but a passing guard said \\r\\nthere wasn’t one. In the end a passing guard strode away, \\r\\nmuttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying \\r\\nhard not to panic. According to the large clock over \\r\\nthe arrivals board, Harry had ten minutes left to get on \\r\\nthe train to Hogwarts and Harry had no idea how to do it; \\r\\nHarry was stranded in the middle of a station with a \\r\\ntrunk Harry could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard \\r\\nmoney, and a large owl. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 101 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell Harry something you \\r\\nhad to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to \\r\\nget into Diagon Alley. Harry wondered if Harry should get \\r\\nout Harry wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s \\r\\nstand between platforms nine and ten. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind \\r\\nHarry and Harry caught a few words of what a group of people were \\r\\nsaying. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump \\r\\nwoman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming \\r\\nred hair. Each of a plump \\r\\nwoman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming \\r\\nred hair was pushing a trunk like \\r\\nHarry’s in front of Harry — and they had an owl. \\r\\n\\r\\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed Harry cart after they. \\r\\nthey stopped and so did Harry, just near enough to hear \\r\\nwhat they were saying. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ \\r\\nmother. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red- \\r\\nheaded, who was holding a small girl hand, “a small girl, can’t I go \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, \\r\\nPercy, you go first.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward \\r\\nplatforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to \\r\\nblink in case Harry missed case — but just as the oldest boyreached the dividing barrier between the two \\r\\nplatforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in \\r\\nfront of Harry and by the time the last backpack had \\r\\ncleared away, the oldest boy had vanished. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 102 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m FredFred, I’m George,” said the oldest boy. “Honestly, \\r\\nwoman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell \\r\\nI’m George?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry, I’m George, dear.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the oldest boy, and off the oldest boy \\r\\nwent. the oldest boy twin called after the oldest boy to hurry up, and the oldest boy \\r\\nmust have done so, because a second later, the oldest boy had \\r\\ngone — but how had the oldest boy done His twin? \\r\\n\\r\\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the \\r\\nbarrier — the third brother was almost there — and then, quite \\r\\nsuddenly, the third brother wasn’t anywhere. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing else for it. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hello, dear,” the plump woman said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s \\r\\nnew, too.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe plump woman pointed at the last and youngest of the plump woman sons. Ron’s \\r\\n \\r\\nwas tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands \\r\\nand feet, and a long nose. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — The thing is, I don’t \\r\\nknow how to — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“How to get onto the platform?” the plump woman said kindly, and \\r\\nHarry nodded. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not to worry,” the plump woman said. “All you have to do is walk \\r\\nstraight at the barrier between platforms nine and \\r\\nten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into \\r\\nit, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if \\r\\nyou’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 103 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — okay,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon pushed Ron trolley around and stared at the \\r\\nbarrier. It looked very solid. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon started to walk toward It. People jostled Ron on \\r\\nPeople way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked \\r\\nmore quickly. Harry was going to smash right into the \\r\\nbarrier and then Harry’d be in trouble — leaning forward \\r\\non Harry cart, Ron broke into a heavy run — the barrier \\r\\nwas coming nearer and nearer — Harry wouldn’t be able \\r\\nto stop — his cart was out of control — Ron was a foot \\r\\naway — Ron closed Ron eyes ready for the crash — \\r\\n\\r\\nIt didn’t come ... Ron kept on running ... Ron opened his eyes. \\r\\n\\r\\nA scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform \\r\\npacked with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts \\r\\nExpress, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind Harry and \\r\\nsaw a wrought-iron archway where the \\r\\nbarrier had \\r\\nbeen, with the words Platform Nine and Three- \\r\\nQuarters on it. Harry had done it. \\r\\n\\r\\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the \\r\\nchattering crowd, while cats of every color wound \\r\\nhere and there between the \\r\\nchattering crowd legs. Owls hooted to one \\r\\nanother in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble \\r\\nand the scraping of heavy trunks. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first few carriages were already packed with \\r\\nstudents, some hanging out of the window to talk to \\r\\nThe first few carriages families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed \\r\\nHarry cart off down a platform \\r\\npacked with people in search of an empty \\r\\nseat. Harry passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \\r\\n“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Neville,” Harry heard the old woman sigh. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 104 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small \\r\\ncrowd. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give us a look, Lee, go on.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA boy with dreadlocks lifted the lid of a box in A boy with dreadlocks arms, and the \\r\\npeople around A boy with dreadlocks shrieked and yelled as something \\r\\ninside poked out a long, hairy leg. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry pressed on through a small \\r\\ncrowd until Harry found \\r\\nan empty compartment near the end of the train. Harry \\r\\nput Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and \\r\\nheave Harry trunk toward the train door. Harry tried to lift \\r\\nit up the steps but could hardly raise one end and \\r\\ntwice Harry dropped it painfully on Harry foot. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins \\r\\nHarry’d followed through the barrier. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, please,” Harry panted. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!” \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the red-haired twins \\r\\n’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked \\r\\naway in a corner of an empty compartment near the end of the train. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing Harry sweaty hair out of \\r\\nHarry eyes. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s that?” said one of the red-haired twins \\r\\n suddenly, \\r\\npointing at Harry’s lightning scar. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry is,” said the other twin. “Aren’t you?” Harry added to Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 105 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“ Harry Potter,” chorused the red-haired twins \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Harry,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe two boys gawked at Harry, and Harry felt Harry \\r\\nturning red. Then, to Harry relief, a voice came floating \\r\\nin through the train’s open door. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Fred? I’m George? Are you there?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Coming, a small girl.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWith a last look at Harry, the red-haired twins \\r\\n hopped off the \\r\\ntrain. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half \\r\\nhidden, Harry could watch the red-haired family on the \\r\\nplatform and hear what the red-haired twins \\r\\n were saying. the red-haired twins \\r\\n \\r\\nmother had just taken out Their \\r\\nmother handkerchief. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but The youngest boy \\r\\ngrabbed The youngest boy and began rubbing the end of The youngest boy nose. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Mom — geroff.” The youngest boy wriggled free. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on The youngest boy nosie?” \\r\\nsaid one of the red-haired twins \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut up,” said Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where’s \\r\\n Percy?” said Their \\r\\nmother. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The youngest boy’s \\r\\n coming now.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest boy came striding into sight. The youngest boy had \\r\\nalready changed into The youngest boy billowing black Hogwarts \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 106 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nrobes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge \\r\\non Harry chest with the letter P on it. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t stay long, Their \\r\\nmother,” The youngest boy said. “I’m up front, the \\r\\nprefects have got two compartments to the \\r\\nprefects — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the red-haired twins \\r\\n, \\r\\nwith an air of great surprise. “You should have said \\r\\nsomething, we had no idea.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hang on, I think I remember The youngest boy saying something \\r\\nabout it,” said the other twin. “Once — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Or twice — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“A minute — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“All summer — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one \\r\\nof the red-haired twins \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Because Percy’s a prefect,” said Their \\r\\nmother fondly. “All \\r\\nright, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl \\r\\nwhen you get there.” \\r\\n\\r\\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and Percy left. Then She \\r\\nturned to the red-haired twins \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I \\r\\nget one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up \\r\\na toilet or — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” \\r\\n“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 107 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with We.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut up,” said Ron again. Ron was almost as tall as \\r\\nthe red-haired twins \\r\\n already and Ron nose was still pink where \\r\\nTheir \\r\\nmother had rubbed his nose. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, a small girl, guess what? Guess who we just met on \\r\\nthe train?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see Harry \\r\\nlooking. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in \\r\\nthe station? Know who black-haired boy who was near us in \\r\\n is?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Who?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Harry Potted” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry heard the little girl’s voice. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see black-haired boy who was near us in \\r\\n, Mom, \\r\\noh please. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve already seen black-haired boy who was near us in \\r\\n, Ginny, and the poor boy \\r\\nisn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is black-haired boy who was near us in \\r\\n really, \\r\\nFred? How do you know?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Asked black-haired boy who was near us in \\r\\n. Saw black-haired boy who was near us in \\r\\n scar. It’s really there — like \\r\\nlightning.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. he \\r\\nwas ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the \\r\\nplatform.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what \\r\\nYou-Know-Who looks like?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 108 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir \\r\\nmother suddenly became very stern. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I forbid you to ask he, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As \\r\\nthough he needs reminding of that on he first day at \\r\\nschool.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, keep your hair on.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA whistle sounded. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hurry up!” Their \\r\\nmother said, and the three boys \\r\\nclambered onto the train. their leaned out of the \\r\\nwindow for her to kiss their good-bye, and their \\r\\nyounger sister began to cry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Georg e\\\\” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Only joking, a small girl.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother \\r\\nwaving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, \\r\\nrunning to keep up with the train until the train gathered too \\r\\nmuch speed, then the boys’ mother \\r\\n fell back and waved. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry watched the girl and the boys’ mother \\r\\n mother disappear as \\r\\nthe train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the \\r\\nwindow. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. Harry \\r\\ndidn’t know what Harry was going to — but He \\r\\n had to be \\r\\nbetter than what Harry was leaving behind. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the \\r\\nyoungest redheaded boy came in. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Anyone sitting there?” the \\r\\nyoungest redheaded boy asked, pointing at a Hogwarts toilet seat. “Everywhere else is full.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 109 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry shook Harry head and the \\r\\nyoungest redheaded boy sat down. Harry \\r\\nglanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the \\r\\nwindow, pretending the \\r\\nyoungest redheaded boy hadn’t looked. Harry saw Harry \\r\\nstill had a black mark on Harry nose. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, Ron.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe twins were back. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — \\r\\n\\r\\nLee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Right,” mumbled Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce \\r\\nwe? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, \\r\\nwe brother. See you later, then.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the \\r\\ncompartment door shut behind The twins. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry nodded. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and \\r\\nLee Jordan’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — \\r\\nyou know ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon pointed at Harry’s forehead. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry pulled back Harry bangs to show the lightning \\r\\nscar. Ron stared. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 110 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing \\r\\nelse.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wow,” said Ron. Ron sat and stared at Harry for a few \\r\\nmoments, then, as though Ron had suddenly realized \\r\\nwhat Ron was doing, Ron looked quickly out of the \\r\\nwindow again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found \\r\\nRon just as interesting as Ron found Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a \\r\\nsecond cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk \\r\\nabout an accountant.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“So you must know loads of magic already.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding \\r\\nfamilies the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked \\r\\nabout. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. \\r\\n“What are they like?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Horrible — well, not all of they. My aunt and uncle \\r\\nand cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard \\r\\nbrothers.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, Ron was looking \\r\\ngloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. \\r\\nYou could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and \\r\\nCharlie have already left — Bill was head boy and \\r\\nCharlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect. Fred and I’m George mess around a lot, but Fred and George \\r\\nstill get really good marks and everyone thinks Fred and George’re \\r\\nreally funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the \\r\\nothers, but if I do, as well’s no big deal, because Everyone did no big deal \\r\\nfirst. You never get anything new, either, with five \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 111 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbrothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Now Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect old wand, \\r\\nand Percy’s old rat.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon reached inside Ron jacket and pulled out a fat \\r\\ngray rat, which was asleep. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ron name’s Scabbers and Ron’s useless, Ron hardly ever \\r\\nwakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being \\r\\nmade a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got \\r\\nScabbers instead.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon’s ears went pink. Percy seemed to think Percy’d said \\r\\ntoo much, because Percy went back to staring out of the \\r\\nwindow. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not \\r\\nbeing able to afford an owl. After all, Harry’d never had \\r\\nany money in Harry life until a month ago, and Harry told \\r\\nRon so, all about having to wear Dudley’s \\r\\n old clothes \\r\\nand never getting proper birthday presents. This \\r\\nseemed to cheer Ron up. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything \\r\\nabout being a wizard or about my parents or \\r\\nVoldemort — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon gasped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ You said You-Know-Who’s name\\\\” said Ron, sounding \\r\\nboth shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, \\r\\nof all people — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the \\r\\nname,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. \\r\\nSee what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,” he \\r\\nadded, voicing for the first time something that had \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 112 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbeen worrying 112 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in \\r\\nthe class.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You won’t be. ThereNow Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect loads of people who come from \\r\\nMuggle families and There’s loads of people who come from \\r\\nMuggle families learn quick enough.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile There’s loads of people who come from \\r\\nMuggle families had been talking, the train had carried \\r\\nThere’s loads of people who come from \\r\\nMuggle families out of London. Now There’s loads of people who come from \\r\\nMuggle families were speeding past \\r\\nfields full of cows and sheep. There’s loads of people who come from \\r\\nMuggle families were quiet for a \\r\\ntime, watching the fields and lanes flick past. \\r\\n\\r\\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering \\r\\noutside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman \\r\\nslid back a smiling, dimpled woman \\r\\n door and said, “Anything off the cart, \\r\\ndears?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to Harry feet, \\r\\nbut Ron’s ears went pink again and Ron muttered that \\r\\nRon’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had never had any money for candy with the \\r\\nDursleys, and now that Harry had pockets rattling with \\r\\ngold and silver Harry was ready to buy Mars Bars as Harry could carry — but a smiling, dimpled woman \\r\\n didn’t have \\r\\nMars Bars. What a smiling, dimpled woman \\r\\n did have were Now Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect \\r\\nEvery Flavor Beans, Bertie Bott’s \\r\\n Best Blowing Gum, \\r\\nChocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, \\r\\nLicorice Wands, and a number of other strange things \\r\\nHarry had never seen in Harry life. Not wanting to miss \\r\\nanything, Harry got some of everything and paid a smiling, dimpled woman \\r\\n eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the \\r\\ncompartment and tipped the \\r\\ncompartment onto an empty seat. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hungry, are you?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 113 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a \\r\\npumpkin pasty. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and a lumpy packagea lumpy package. There were four sandwiches inside. Ron pulled one \\r\\nof four sandwiches apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t \\r\\nlike corned beef.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a \\r\\npasty. “Go on — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t want this, this’s all dry,” said Ron. “She \\r\\nhasn’t got much time,” Ron added quickly, “you know, \\r\\nwith five of us.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had \\r\\nanything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share \\r\\nit with. it was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, \\r\\neating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, \\r\\nand candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \\r\\n\\r\\n“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a \\r\\npack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are \\r\\nThey?” Harry was starting to feel that nothing would \\r\\nsurprise Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing \\r\\nAgrippa.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs \\r\\nhave cards inside Frogs \\r\\n, you know, to collect — \\r\\nfamous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five \\r\\nhundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry unwrapped Harry Chocolate Frog and picked up \\r\\nthe card. his Chocolate Frog showed a man’s face. a man’s face wore half-moon \\r\\nglasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 114 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nhair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture \\r\\nwas the name Albus Dumbledore. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“So this is Albus Dumbledore!” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Albus Dumbledore!” said \\r\\nRon. “Can I have a frog? I might get — thanks \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry turned over the card and read: \\r\\n\\r\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE \\r\\n\\r\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS \\r\\n\\r\\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern \\r\\ntimes, Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore \\r\\ndefeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the \\r\\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon \\r\\nwork on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel. \\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten \\r\\npin bowling. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry \\r\\nastonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had \\r\\ndisappeared. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Albus Dumbledoregone!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you can’t expect Albus Dumbledore to hang around all day,” \\r\\nsaid Ron. “Albus Dumbledore’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again \\r\\nand I’ve got about six of Morgana ... do you want it? You \\r\\ncan start collecting.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs \\r\\nwaiting to be unwrapped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the \\r\\nMuggle world, people just stay put in photos.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 115 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded \\r\\namazed. “Weird).” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stared as Albus Dumbledore sidled back into the \\r\\npicture on Harry card and gave Harry a small smile. Ronwas more interested in eating the frogs than looking \\r\\nat the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harrycouldn’t keep Ron’s eyes off the Famous Witches. Soon Harry had not only \\r\\nDumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, \\r\\nAlberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. Ron \\r\\nfinally tore Ron’s eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, \\r\\nwho was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie \\r\\nBott’s Every Flavor Beans. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned \\r\\nHarry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every \\r\\nflavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like \\r\\nchocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then \\r\\nyou can get spinach and liver and tripe. George \\r\\nreckons George \\r\\n had a booger-flavored one once.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at a green bean carefully, \\r\\nand bit into a corner. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSprouts had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. \\r\\nHarry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, \\r\\ncurry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave \\r\\nenough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron \\r\\nwouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe countryside now flying past the window was \\r\\nbecoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there \\r\\nwere woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment \\r\\nand the round-faced boy Harry had passed on \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nplatform nine and three-quarters came in. Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n looked \\r\\ntearful. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry,” Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they shook they heads, Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n wailed, “I’ve lost \\r\\nPage | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n! Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n keeps getting away from Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hell turn up,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n miserably. “Well, if you see Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n ...” \\r\\nPage | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n left. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t know why Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d \\r\\nbrought a toad I’d lose I’d \\r\\nbrought a toad as quick as I could. Mind \\r\\nyou, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n might have died and you wouldn’t know the \\r\\ndifference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nyellow yesterday to make Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n more interesting, but \\r\\nthe spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n rummaged around in Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n trunk and pulled out a \\r\\nvery battered-looking wand. a \\r\\nvery battered-looking wand was chipped in places \\r\\nand something white was glinting at the end. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Unicorn hairNow Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect nearly poking out. Anyway — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n had just raised a \\r\\nvery battered-looking wand when the compartment \\r\\ndoor slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but \\r\\nthis time The toadless boy had a girl with The toadless boy. a girl was already \\r\\nwearing a girl new Hogwarts robes. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Has anyone seen a toad? Now Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect lost one,” a girl said. \\r\\na girl had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown \\r\\nhair, and rather large front teeth. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 117 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve already told Now Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect We haven’t seen it,” said Ron, \\r\\nbut a girl wasn’t listening, a girl was looking at a \\r\\nvery battered-looking wand in Now Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect hand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, are you doing magic? LetNow Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect see it, then.” \\r\\n\\r\\na girl sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — all right.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon cleared Ron throat. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, \\r\\n\\r\\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon waved a \\r\\nvery battered-looking wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers \\r\\nstayed gray and fast asleep. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said a girl. “Well, \\r\\nit’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells \\r\\njust for practice and itNow Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect worked for me. Nobody in \\r\\nmy familyNow Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect magic at all, it was ever such a surprise \\r\\nwhen I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of \\r\\ncourse, I mean, my letter’s the very best school of witchcraft \\r\\nthere is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books \\r\\nby heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I“ \\r\\nHermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione Granger said all this very fast. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by Harry \\r\\nstunned face that Harry hadn’t learned all the course \\r\\nbooks by heart either. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 118 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about \\r\\nyou, of course — I got a few extra books for \\r\\nbackground reading, and you’re in Modern Magical \\r\\nHistory and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and \\r\\nGreat Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out \\r\\neverything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do \\r\\neither of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been \\r\\nasking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds \\r\\nby far the best; I hear Albus Dumbledore was in it, \\r\\nbut I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ... \\r\\nAnyway, we’d better go and look for Now Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect toad. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll \\r\\nbe there soon.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with she. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Whatever what House I’m in, I hope she’s not in what House,” said \\r\\nRon. Ron threw a \\r\\nvery battered-looking wand back into his trunk. “Stupid \\r\\nspell — George \\r\\n gave it to George \\r\\n, bet George \\r\\n knew it was a \\r\\ndud.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“what House what House are your brothers in?” asked Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nGryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling \\r\\non Ron again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t \\r\\nknow what Mom and Dad’ll say if ’m. I don’t suppose \\r\\nRavenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if Mom and Dad put \\r\\nme in Slytherin.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was \\r\\nin?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah,” said Ron. Ron flopped back into Ron seat, \\r\\nlooking depressed. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 119 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are \\r\\na bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off \\r\\nHouses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that \\r\\nyour oldest brothers’ve left, anyway?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once Harry’d \\r\\nfinished school. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in \\r\\nAfrica doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did \\r\\nyou hear about Gringotts? ItNow Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect been all over the Daily \\r\\nProphet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the \\r\\nMuggles — someone tried to rob a high security \\r\\nvault.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stared. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Really? What happened to them?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t \\r\\nbeen caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful \\r\\nDark wizard to get GringottsGringotts, but They don’t \\r\\nthink They took anything, that’s “Charlie’s in Romania odd. ’Course, \\r\\neveryone gets scared when something like this \\r\\nhappens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry turned this news over in Harry mind. Harry was \\r\\nstarting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know- \\r\\nWho was mentioned. Harry supposed this was all part of \\r\\nentering the magical world, but this had been a lot more \\r\\ncomfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying. \\r\\n\\r\\n“WhatNow Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect your Quidditch team?” Ron asked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it“Charlie’s in Romaniathe best game in the world — ” And Ron was off, \\r\\nexplaining all about the four balls and the positions of \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 120 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe seven players, describing famous games Ron’d been \\r\\nto with Ron brothers and the broomstick Ron’d like to \\r\\nget if Ron had the money. Ron was just taking Harrythrough the finer points of the game when the \\r\\ncompartment door slid open yet again, but the \\r\\ncompartment door wasn’t \\r\\nNeville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this \\r\\ntime. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle \\r\\none at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s \\r\\nrobe shop. the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s \\r\\nrobe shop was looking at Harry with a lot more \\r\\ninterest than the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s \\r\\nrobe shop’d shown back in Diagon Alley. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it true?” the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s \\r\\nrobe shop said. “Three boys’re saying all down the train \\r\\nthat Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So all down the train \\r\\nthat Harry Potter’s in this compartment’s you, is \\r\\nall down the train \\r\\nthat Harry Potter’s in this compartment?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Harry. the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s \\r\\nrobe shop was looking at Three boys. \\r\\nBoth of Three boys were thickset and looked extremely \\r\\nmean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, Both of them \\r\\nlooked like bodyguards. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale \\r\\nboy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been \\r\\nhiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who \\r\\nyou are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red \\r\\nhair, freckles, and more children than they can \\r\\nafford.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMy father turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some \\r\\nwizarding families are much better than others, \\r\\n\\r\\nPotter. You don’t want to go making friends with the \\r\\nwrong sort. I can help you there.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 121 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father held out My father hand to shake “Charlie’s in Romania, but Harrydidn’t take his hand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for My father, \\r\\nthanks,” My father said coolly. \\r\\n\\r\\nDraco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared \\r\\nin Draco Malfoy pale cheeks. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” My father said slowly. \\r\\n“Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as \\r\\nyour parents. your parents didn’t know what was good for \\r\\nyour parents, either. You hang around with riffraff like the \\r\\nWeasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Say that again,” Ron said, Ron face as red as Ron hair. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Draco Malfoysneered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely \\r\\nthan Harry felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot \\r\\nbigger than Harry or Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But us don’t feel like leaving, do us, boys? us’ve \\r\\neaten all us food and you still seem to have some.” \\r\\n\\r\\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to \\r\\nRon leapt forward, but before Ron’d so much as \\r\\ntouched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. \\r\\n\\r\\nScabbers the rat was hanging off Scabbers finger, sharp \\r\\nlittle teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbersround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally \\r\\nflew off and hit the window, all three of — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy \\r\\ndisappeared at once. Perhaps — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy thought there were \\r\\nPage | 122 “Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmore rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps \\r\\n— Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy’d heard footsteps, because a second later, \\r\\nHermione Granger had come in. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the \\r\\nsweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbersby Ron tail. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think RonNow Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it \\r\\n— Now Percy’s a \\r\\nprefect gone back to sleep.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so Ron had. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve met Draco Malfoy before?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry explained about — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy meeting in Diagon Alley. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve heard of Harry family,” said Ron darkly. “— Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy were \\r\\nsome of the first to come back to — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy side after You- \\r\\nKnow-Who disappeared. Said — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy’d been bewitched. \\r\\nMy dad doesn’t believe it. My dad says Draco Malfoyfather \\r\\ndidn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” My dad \\r\\nturned to Hermione. “Can — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy help you with \\r\\nsomething?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve \\r\\njust been up to the front to ask the conductor, and the conductor \\r\\nsays — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, \\r\\nhave you? You’ll be in trouble before — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy even get \\r\\nthere!” \\r\\n\\r\\nScabbers has been fighting, not — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy,” said Ron, \\r\\nscowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while — Crabbe \\r\\nand Malfoy \\r\\nchange?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right — I only came in here because people \\r\\noutside are behaving very childishly, racing up and \\r\\ndown the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 123 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you \\r\\nknow?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRon glared at her as her left. Harry peered out of the \\r\\nwindow. It was getting dark. Harry could see mountains \\r\\nand forests under a deep purple sky. The train did \\r\\nseem to be slowing down. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon, \\r\\n took off Ron, \\r\\n jackets and pulled on Ron, \\r\\n . “Charlie’s in Romania were a bit short for Ron, you \\r\\ncould see Ron sneakers underneath Ron, \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\nA voice echoed through The train: “Ron, \\r\\n will be reaching \\r\\nHogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your \\r\\nluggage on The train, The train will be taken to the school \\r\\nseparately.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, Ron \\r\\nsaw, looked pale under Ron freckles. They crammed \\r\\nThey pockets with the last of the sweets and joined \\r\\nthe crowd thronging the corridor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. \\r\\nPeople pushed People way toward the door and out on \\r\\nto a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold \\r\\nnight air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads \\r\\nof the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \\r\\n“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, \\r\\nHarry?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \\r\\n\\r\\n“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer \\r\\nstep, now! Firs’ years follow me!” \\r\\n\\r\\nSlipping and stumbling, ” \\r\\n\\r\\nSlipping and stumbling followed Hagrid’s down \\r\\nwhat seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so \\r\\ndark on either side of ” \\r\\n\\r\\nSlipping and stumbling that Harry thought there \\r\\nmust be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 124 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNeville, the boy who kept losing Harry Potter toad, sniffed once \\r\\nor twice. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid \\r\\ncalled over Hagrid \\r\\n shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a loud “Oooooh!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge \\r\\nof a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain \\r\\non the other side, the other side windows sparkling in the starry \\r\\nsky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid’s called, pointing to \\r\\na fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. \\r\\nHarry and Ron were followed into Harry and Ron boat by Neville \\r\\nand Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to \\r\\nhimself. “Right then — FORWARD!” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, \\r\\ngliding across the lake, which was as smooth as \\r\\nglass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great \\r\\ncastle overhead. It towered over Everyone as Everyone sailed \\r\\nnearer and nearer to the cliff on which It stood. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid’s as the first boats reached \\r\\nthe cliff; they all bent they all heads and the little boats \\r\\ncarried they all through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide \\r\\nopening in the cliff face. they all were carried along a \\r\\ndark tunnel, which seemed to be taking they all right \\r\\nunderneath the great \\r\\ncastle overhead, until they all reached a kind of \\r\\nunderground harbor, where they all clambered out onto \\r\\nrocks and pebbles. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who \\r\\nwas checking the boats as people climbed out of \\r\\nthe boats. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 125 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Trevor!” cried Neville \\r\\n blissfully, holding out his \\r\\nhands. Then they all clambered up a passageway in the \\r\\nrock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto \\r\\nsmooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the great \\r\\ncastle overhead. \\r\\n\\r\\nthey all walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded \\r\\naround the huge, oak front door. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid’s raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times \\r\\non front door. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 126 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SORTING HAT \\r\\n\\r\\nfront door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired \\r\\nwitch in emerald-green robes stood there. A tall, black-haired \\r\\nwitch in emerald-green robes had a \\r\\nvery stern face and “Charlie’s in Romania first thought was that this \\r\\nwas not someone to cross. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid’s. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, Hagrid’s. I will take Hagrid’s from here.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA tall, black-haired \\r\\nwitch in emerald-green robes pulled front door wide. The entrance hall was so \\r\\nbig you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ \\r\\nhouse in The entrance hall. The stone walls were lit with flaming \\r\\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too \\r\\nhigh to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase \\r\\nfacing flaming \\r\\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts led to the upper floors. \\r\\n\\r\\nflaming \\r\\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts followed Professor McGonagall across the \\r\\nflagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of \\r\\nhundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the \\r\\nrest of the school must already be here — but \\r\\nProfessor McGonagall showed the first years into a \\r\\nsmall, empty chamber off The entrance hall. flaming \\r\\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts crowded in, \\r\\nPage | 127 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nstanding rather closer together than flaming \\r\\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts would \\r\\nusually have done, peering about nervously. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. \\r\\n“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but \\r\\nbefore you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will \\r\\nbe sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very \\r\\nimportant ceremony because, while you are here, \\r\\nyour House will be something like your family within \\r\\nHogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your \\r\\nHouse, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free \\r\\ntime in your House common room. \\r\\n\\r\\n“your Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, \\r\\nRavenclaw, and Slytherin. House House has House own \\r\\nnoble history and each has produced outstanding \\r\\nwitches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your \\r\\ntriumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- \\r\\nbreaking will lose House points. At the end of the \\r\\nyear, the House with the most points is awarded the \\r\\nHouse cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a \\r\\ncredit to whichever House becomes yours. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few \\r\\nminutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest \\r\\nyou all smarten yourselves up as much as you can \\r\\nwhile you are waiting.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, \\r\\nwhich was fastened under Neville’s left ear, and on “Charlie’s in Romaniasmudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten Harry \\r\\nhair. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said \\r\\nProfessor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 128 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“How exactly do they sort we into Houses?” he asked \\r\\nRon. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but \\r\\nI think Fred was joking.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of \\r\\nthe whole school? But Fred didn’t know any magic yet \\r\\n— what on earth would Fred have to do? Fred hadn’t \\r\\nexpected something like this the moment they \\r\\narrived. Fred looked around anxiously and saw that \\r\\neveryone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking \\r\\nmuch except Hermione Granger, who was whispering \\r\\nvery fast about all the spells No one’d learned and \\r\\nwondering which one No one’d need. Harry tried hard not \\r\\nto listen to No one. He’d never been more nervous, never, \\r\\nnot even when Harry’d had to take a school report home \\r\\nto the Dursleys saying that Harry’d somehow turned Harry \\r\\nteachers wig blue. Harry kept Harry eyes fixed on the door. \\r\\nAny second now, Professor McGonagall would come \\r\\nback and lead Professor McGonagall to Professor McGonagall doom. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen something happened that made Professor McGonagall jump about \\r\\na foot in the air — several people behind Professor McGonagall \\r\\nscreamed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What the — ?” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall gasped. So did the people around Professor McGonagall. About \\r\\ntwenty ghosts had just streamed through the back \\r\\nwall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, About \\r\\ntwenty ghosts \\r\\nglided across the room talking to one another and \\r\\nhardly glancing at the first years. they \\r\\n seemed to be \\r\\narguing. What looked like a fat little monk was \\r\\nsaying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give \\r\\na fat little monk a second chance — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the \\r\\nchances a fat little monk deserves? a fat little monk gives us all a bad name and \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 129 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nyou know, a fat little monk’s not really even a ghost — I say, what \\r\\nare you all doing here?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly \\r\\nnoticed the first years. \\r\\n\\r\\nNobody answered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“New students!” said My dear Friar, smiling around at \\r\\nNew students. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?” \\r\\n\\r\\nA few people nodded mutely. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said My dear Friar. “My old \\r\\nHouse, you know.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting \\r\\nCeremony’s about to start.” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, About \\r\\ntwenty ghosts floated away through the back \\r\\nwall. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first \\r\\nyears, “and follow me.” \\r\\n\\r\\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, \\r\\nHarry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with \\r\\nRon behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, \\r\\nback across the hall, and through a pair of double \\r\\ndoors into the Great Hall. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and \\r\\nsplendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands \\r\\nof candles that were floating in midair over four long \\r\\ntables, where the rest of the students were sitting. \\r\\nfour long \\r\\ntables, where the rest of the students were sitting. \\r\\n were laid with glittering golden plates \\r\\nand goblets. At the top of the hall was another long \\r\\ntable where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they \\r\\nPage | 130 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncame to a halt in a line facing the other students, \\r\\nwith the teachers behind the other students. The hundreds of faces \\r\\nstaring at the other students looked like pale lanterns in the \\r\\nflickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among \\r\\nthe students, About \\r\\ntwenty ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to \\r\\navoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and \\r\\nsaw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. Harry heard \\r\\nHermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky \\r\\noutside. I read about It in Hogwarts, A History.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, \\r\\nand that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the \\r\\nheavens. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor \\r\\nsilently placed a four-legged stool in front \\r\\nof the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat. a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat was patched and frayed and \\r\\nextremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat in \\r\\nthe house. \\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of a rabbit, Harrythought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — \\r\\nnoticing that everyone in the Great Hall was now staring at \\r\\na pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat, Harry stared at a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat, too. For a few seconds, there \\r\\nwas complete silence. Then a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat twitched. A rip \\r\\nnear the brim opened wide like a mouth — and a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat began to sing: \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, \\r\\n\\r\\nBut don’t judge on what you see, \\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll eat Harry if you can find \\r\\n\\r\\nA smarter hat than Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can keep your bowlers black, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 131 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYour top hats sleek and tall, \\r\\n\\r\\nFor I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat \\r\\nAnd I can cap Your top hats. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s nothing hidden in your head \\r\\na pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat can’t see, \\r\\n\\r\\nSo try me on and I will tell you \\r\\nWhere you ought to be. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou might belong in Gryffindor, \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere dwell the brave at heart, \\r\\n\\r\\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry \\r\\nSet Gryffindors apart; \\r\\n\\r\\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff, \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere Their are just and loyal, \\r\\n\\r\\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true \\r\\nAnd unafraid of toil; \\r\\n\\r\\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw, \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’ve a ready mind, \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere those of wit and learning, \\r\\n\\r\\nWill always find those of wit and learning kind; \\r\\n\\r\\nOr perhaps in Slytherin \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 132 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou’ll make your real friends, \\r\\n\\r\\nThose cunning folk use any means \\r\\nTo achieve Those cunning folk ends. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo put me on! Don’t be afraid l\\\\ \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd don’t get in a flap\\\\ \\r\\n\\r\\nYou’re in safe hands (though I have none) \\r\\n\\r\\nFor I’m a Thinking Cap\\\\” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole hall burst into applause as a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat finished \\r\\nThe whole hall song. The whole hall bowed to each of the four tables and then \\r\\nbecame quite still again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So we’ve just got to try on a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat!” Ron whispered to HarryHarry. “I’ll kill Fred, Fred was going on about wrestling \\r\\na troll.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat was a lot \\r\\nbetter than having to do a spell, but Fred did wish they \\r\\ncould have tried a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat on without everyone watching. a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel \\r\\nbrave or quick-witted or any of a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat at the moment. If \\r\\nonly the hat had mentioned a House for people who \\r\\nfelt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for \\r\\nhim. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a \\r\\nlong roll of parchment. \\r\\n\\r\\n“When I call your name, you will put on a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat and \\r\\nsit on the stool to be sorted,” Professor McGonagall said. “Abbott, \\r\\nHannah!” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 133 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of \\r\\nline, put on the hat, which fell right down over A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtailseyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause — \\r\\n\\r\\nHufflepuff!” shouted a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as \\r\\nHannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry saw the ghost of My dear Friar waving merrily at \\r\\nher. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bones, Susan!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHufflepuff!” shouted a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat again, and Susanscuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Boot, Terry!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“RAVENCLAW!” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Hufflepuff table second from the left clapped this time; \\r\\nseveral Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with \\r\\nTerry as \\r\\nTerry joined several Ravenclaws. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but \\r\\n“Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, \\r\\nand the table on the far left exploded with cheers; \\r\\nHarry could see “Charlie’s in Romania twin brothers catcalling. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. \\r\\nPerhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all Harry’d \\r\\nheard about Slytherin, but Harry thought they looked \\r\\nlike an unpleasant lot. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was starting to feel definitely sick now. Harry \\r\\nremembered being picked for teams during gym at Harry \\r\\nold school. Harry had always been last to be chosen, not \\r\\nbecause Harry was no good, but because no one wanted \\r\\nDudley to think they liked Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 134 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” \\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, Harry noticed, a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat shouted out the \\r\\nHouse at once, but at others the \\r\\nHouse took a little while to \\r\\ndecide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy \\r\\nnext to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a \\r\\nwhole minute before a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat declared him a \\r\\nGryffindor. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Granger, Hermione!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hateagerly on Hermione head. \\r\\n\\r\\n“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat. Ron groaned. \\r\\n\\r\\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts \\r\\nalways do when you’re very nervous. What if Harry \\r\\nwasn’t chosen at all? What if Harry just sat there with \\r\\nthe hat over Harry eyes for ages, until Professor \\r\\njerked it off Harry head and said there had \\r\\nobviously been a mistake and Harry’d better get back on \\r\\nthe train? \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his \\r\\ntoad, was called, his fell over on his way to the stool. \\r\\na pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat took a long time to decide with his. When \\r\\na pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”,” his ran off still \\r\\nwearing a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter \\r\\nto give a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy swaggered forward when ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy name was called \\r\\nand got ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy wish at once: a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat had barely touched \\r\\n” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy when a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy went to join ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle, \\r\\nlooking pleased with ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 135 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere weren’t many people left now. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Moon” , “Nott” ... , “Parkinson” ... , then a pair of \\r\\ntwin girls, “Path” and “Path” ... , then “Perks, Sally- \\r\\nAnne” . . . , and then, at last — \\r\\n\\r\\n“Potter, Harry!” \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke \\r\\nout like little hissing fires all over the hall. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Potter , did Anne” say?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“ “ Potter?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe last thing Harry saw before a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat dropped over \\r\\nHarry eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a \\r\\ngood look at Harry. Next second Harry was looking at the \\r\\nblack inside of a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat. Harry waited. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hmm,” said a small voice in Harry ear. “Difficult. Very \\r\\ndifficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind \\r\\neither. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a \\r\\nnice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ... \\r\\nSo where shall I put you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not \\r\\nSlytherin, not Slytherin. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you \\r\\nsure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in \\r\\nyour head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to \\r\\ngreatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re \\r\\nsure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry heard a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat shout the last word to the whole \\r\\nhall. Harry took off a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat and walked shakily toward \\r\\nthe Gryffindor table. Harry was so relieved to have been \\r\\nchosen and not put in Slytherin, Harry hardly noticed \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 136 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthat Harry was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the \\r\\nPrefect got up and shook Harry hand vigorously, while \\r\\nthe Weasley twins yelled, “We got Harry Potter! We got \\r\\nHarry Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff \\r\\nHarry’d seen earlier. the ghost in the ruff \\r\\n patted the ghost in the ruff \\r\\n arm, giving \\r\\nHarry the sudden, horrible feeling the ghost in the ruff \\r\\n’d just plunged his arm \\r\\ninto a bucket of ice-cold water. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe ghost in the ruff \\r\\n could see the High Table properly now. At the end \\r\\nnearest the ghost in the ruff \\r\\n sat Hagrid, who caught the ghost in the ruff \\r\\n eye and gave \\r\\nthe ghost in the ruff \\r\\n the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, \\r\\nin the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, \\r\\nsat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized Albus Dumbledore at once \\r\\nfrom the card Albus Dumbledore’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on \\r\\nthe train. Albus Dumbledore silver hair was the only thing \\r\\nin the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. \\r\\nHarry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous \\r\\nyoung man from the Leaky Cauldron. Harry was looking \\r\\nvery peculiar in a large purple turban. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now there were only four people left to be sorted. \\r\\n“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, \\r\\njoined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” \\r\\nbecame a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. Ron \\r\\nwas pale green by now. Harry crossed Harry fingers \\r\\nunder the table and a second later a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat had \\r\\nshouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed \\r\\ninto a large gold chair next to Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley \\r\\npompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was \\r\\nmade a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up Professor McGonagall \\r\\nscroll and took a pointed \\r\\nwizard’s hat away. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked down at Harry empty gold plate. Harry had \\r\\nonly just realized how hungry Harry was. The pumpkin \\r\\npasties seemed ages ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore feet. Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore was \\r\\nbeaming at the students, Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore arms opened wide, as if \\r\\nnothing could have pleased Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore more than to see \\r\\nthem all there. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Welcome!” Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore said. “Welcome to a new year at \\r\\nHogwarts! Before we begin we banquet, I would like \\r\\nto say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! \\r\\n\\r\\nBlubber! Oddment! Tweak! \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you!” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus Dumbledore sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. \\r\\nHarry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Harry — a bit mad?” Harry asked Percy uncertainly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Mad?” said Percy airily. “Harry’s a genius! Best wizard \\r\\nin the world! But Harry is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, \\r\\nHarry?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of Harry \\r\\nwere now piled with food. Harry had never seen so many \\r\\nthings Harry liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast \\r\\nchicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, \\r\\nbacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, \\r\\nfries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, \\r\\nketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint \\r\\nhumbugs. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but \\r\\nThe Dursleys’d never been allowed to eat as much as The Dursleys liked. \\r\\nDudley had always taken anything that Harry really \\r\\nwanted, even if it made Harry sick. Harry piled Harry plate \\r\\nwith a bit of everything except the peppermints and \\r\\nbegan to eat. It was all delicious. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, \\r\\nwatching Harry cut up Harry steak. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 138 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t you — ?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said \\r\\nthe ghost in the ruff \\r\\n. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does \\r\\nmiss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced Harry? Sir \\r\\nNicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. \\r\\nResident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My \\r\\nbrothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless \\r\\nNick!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n— ” the ghost in the ruff \\r\\n began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus \\r\\nFinnigan interrupted. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?” \\r\\n\\r\\nSir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n— looked extremely miffed, as if their little \\r\\nchat wasn’t going at all the way Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n— wanted. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Like this,” Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n— said irritably. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n— seized Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n— left ear and \\r\\npulled. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n— whole head swung off Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n— neck and fell \\r\\nonto Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n— shoulder as if his shoulder was on a hinge. Someone \\r\\nhad obviously tried to behead Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\r\\n—, but not done Someone \\r\\n \\r\\nproperly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on \\r\\ntheir faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped Nearly Headless Nick head \\r\\nback onto Nearly Headless Nick , coughed, and said, “So — new \\r\\nGryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the \\r\\nHouse Championship this year? Gryffindors have \\r\\nnever gone so long without winning. Slytherins have \\r\\ngot the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s \\r\\nbecoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin \\r\\nghost.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a \\r\\nhorrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a \\r\\ngaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. Harry \\r\\nwas right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 139 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsee, didn’t look too pleased with the seating \\r\\narrangements. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How did Harry get covered in blood?” asked Seamus \\r\\nwith great interest. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nearly Headless Nickdelicately. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as everyone could, the \\r\\nremains of the food faded from the plates, leaving \\r\\neveryone sparkling clean as before. A moment later the \\r\\ndesserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor \\r\\nyou could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate \\r\\neclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- \\r\\n0, rice pudding ... \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Harry helped Harry to a treacle tart, the talk \\r\\nturned to their families. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus \\r\\n. “Me dad’s a Muggle. \\r\\nMom didn’t tell ’s a Muggle. \\r\\n Mom was a witch ’til after they \\r\\nwere married. Bit of a nasty shock for ’s a Muggle. \\r\\n.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe others laughed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What about you, Neville?” said Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Gran brought me up and Mom’s a witch,” \\r\\nsaid Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle \\r\\nfor ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me \\r\\noff my guard and force some magic out of me — My Great Uncle Algie \\r\\npushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly \\r\\ndrowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. \\r\\nMy Great Uncle Algie Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and My Great Uncle Algie was \\r\\nhanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles \\r\\nwhen my Great Auntie Enid offered My Great Uncle Algie a meringue \\r\\nand My Great Uncle Algie accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the \\r\\nway down the garden and into the road. — all the \\r\\nway down the garden and into the road were all \\r\\nPage | 140 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nreally pleased, Gran was crying, Gran was so happy. \\r\\nAnd you should have seen — all the \\r\\nway down the garden and into the road faces when I got in \\r\\nhere — — all the \\r\\nway down the garden and into the road thought I might not be magic enough to \\r\\ncome, you see. My Great Uncle Algie My Great Uncle Algie was so pleased My Great Uncle Algiebought me my toad.” \\r\\n\\r\\nOn he’s the Slytherin \\r\\nghost other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione \\r\\nwere talking about lessons (“I do hope Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione \\r\\n start right \\r\\naway, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly \\r\\ninterested in Transfiguration, you know, turning \\r\\nsomething into something else, of course, it’s \\r\\nsupposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting \\r\\nsmall, just matches into needles and that sort of \\r\\nthing — ”). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, \\r\\nlooked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was \\r\\ndrinking deeply from Hagrid goblet. Professor McGonagallwas talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor \\r\\nQuirrell, in Professor \\r\\nQuirrell absurd turban, was talking to a \\r\\nteacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and \\r\\nsallow skin. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened very suddenly. a \\r\\nteacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and \\r\\nsallow skinlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s \\r\\neyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on \\r\\nHarry’s forehead. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to Harry head. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” asked Percy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“N-nothing.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as The pain had come. Harder \\r\\nto shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the \\r\\nteacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at \\r\\nall. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 141 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Quirrell?” he \\r\\nasked Percy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder \\r\\nQuirrell’s looking so nervous, he’s the Slytherin \\r\\nghost. Quirrell \\r\\nteaches Potions, but Quirrell doesn’t want to — everyone \\r\\nknows Quirrell’s he’s the Slytherin \\r\\nghost . Knows an awful lot \\r\\nabout the Dark Arts, Snape.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t \\r\\nlook at Snape again. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor \\r\\nQuirrellgot to Professor Dumbledore again. The hall fell silent. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all \\r\\nfed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to \\r\\ngive you. \\r\\n\\r\\n“First years should note that the forest on the \\r\\ngrounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our \\r\\nolder students would do well to remember that as \\r\\nwell.” \\r\\n\\r\\nDumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction \\r\\nof the Weasley twins. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to \\r\\nremind you all that no magic should be used between \\r\\nclasses in the corridors. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of \\r\\nthe term. Anyone interested in playing for their House \\r\\nteams should contact Madam Hooch. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- \\r\\nfloor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds \\r\\nto everyone who does not wish to die a very painful \\r\\ndeath.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 142 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry laughed, but the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n was one of the few who did. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n’s not serious?” the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n muttered to Percy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Professor Dumbledore. “Ithe’s the Slytherin \\r\\nghostodd, because he’s the Slytherin \\r\\nghost usually gives us a reason why we’re \\r\\nnot allowed to go somewhere — he’s the Slytherin \\r\\nghost, everyone knows that. I do think he’s the Slytherin \\r\\nghost \\r\\nmight have told us prefects, at least.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And now, before us go to bed, let us sing the school \\r\\nsong!” cried Professor Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other \\r\\nteachers’ smiles had become rather fixed. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Dumbledore gave Professor Dumbledore wand a little flick, as if Professor Dumbledore was \\r\\ntrying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden \\r\\nribbon flew out of he was \\r\\n, which rose high above the tables \\r\\nand twisted he was \\r\\n, snakelike, into words. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Everyone pick Everyone favorite tune,” said Professor Dumbledore, \\r\\n“and off we go!” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the school \\r\\n bellowed: \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, \\r\\n\\r\\nTeach we something please, \\r\\n\\r\\nWhether we be old and bald \\r\\nOr young with scabby knees, \\r\\n\\r\\nwe heads could do with filling \\r\\nWith some interesting stuff, \\r\\n\\r\\nFor now Our heads’re bare and full of air, \\r\\n\\r\\nDead flies and bits of fluff, \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 143 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo teach we things worth knowing, \\r\\n\\r\\nBring back what we’ve forgot, \\r\\n\\r\\nJust do your best, we’ll do the rest, \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd learn until we brains all rot.” \\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, \\r\\nonly the Weasley twins were left singing along to a \\r\\nvery slow funeral march. Professor Dumbledore conducted only the Weasley twins \\r\\nlast few lines with his wand and when only the Weasley twins had \\r\\nfinished, Professor Dumbledore was one of those who clapped loudest. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, music,” Professor Dumbledore said, wiping Professor Dumbledore eyes. “A magic \\r\\nbeyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you \\r\\ntrot!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the \\r\\nchattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the \\r\\nmarble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, \\r\\nbut only because Percy was so tired and full of food. Percy \\r\\nwas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors whispered and \\r\\npointed as the people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors passed, or that Percy Percy led the people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors \\r\\nthrough doorways hidden behind sliding panels and \\r\\nhanging tapestries. the people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors climbed more staircases, \\r\\nyawning and dragging the people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors feet, and Harry was just \\r\\nwondering how much farther the people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors had to go when \\r\\nthe people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors came to a sudden halt. \\r\\n\\r\\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair \\r\\nahead of the people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors, and as Percy took a step toward the people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors \\r\\nthe people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors started throwing the people in \\r\\nthe portraits along the corridors at Percy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A \\r\\npoltergeist.” Percy raised Percy voice, “Peeves — show \\r\\nyourself.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 144 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a \\r\\nballoon, answered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark \\r\\neyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- \\r\\nlegged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oooooooh!” the Bloody Baron said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle \\r\\nFirsties! What fun!” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Bloody Baron swooped suddenly at the walking sticks. the walking sticks ducked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I \\r\\nmean this!” barked Percy. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeeves stuck out Peeves tongue and vanished, dropping \\r\\nthe walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard Peeves \\r\\nzooming away, rattling coats of armor as Peeves passed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as \\r\\nthey set off again. “the Bloody Baron’s the only one \\r\\nwho can control the Bloody Baron, the Bloody Baron won’t even listen to us \\r\\nprefects. Here us are.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a \\r\\nvery fat woman in a pink silk dress. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Password?” a \\r\\nvery fat woman said. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and a portrait of a \\r\\nvery fat woman swung \\r\\nforward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all \\r\\nscrambled through a round hole in the wall — Neville needed a leg up — \\r\\nand found They all \\r\\n in the Gryffindor common \\r\\nroom, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. \\r\\n\\r\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to the girls \\r\\ndormitory and the boys through another. At the top of \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 145 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the \\r\\ntowers — they found they beds at last: five four- \\r\\nposters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. five four- \\r\\nposterstrunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk \\r\\nmuch, Their \\r\\ntrunks pulled on five four- \\r\\nposters pajamas and fell into bed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through \\r\\nthe hangings. “Get off Scabbers! Ron’s chewing my \\r\\nsheets.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was going to ask Ron if Ron’d had any of the \\r\\ntreacle tart, but Harry fell asleep almost at once. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because Harry \\r\\nhad a very strange dream. Harry was wearing Professor \\r\\nQuirrell’s turban, which kept talking to Harry, telling \\r\\nHarry Harry must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it \\r\\nwas Harry destiny. Harry told Quirrell’s turban Harry didn’t want \\r\\nto be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; Harry tried \\r\\nto pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there \\r\\nwas Malfoy, laughing at Harry as Harry struggled with it — \\r\\nthen Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, \\r\\nSnape, whose laugh became high and cold — there \\r\\nwas a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating \\r\\nand shaking. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry rolled over and fell asleep again, and when Harry \\r\\nwoke next day, Harry didn’t remember the dream at all. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 146 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE POTIONS MASTER \\r\\n\\r\\n“There, look.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wearing the glasses?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you see Harry face?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you see Harry scar?” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment Harry left Harry \\r\\ndormitory the next day. People lining up outside \\r\\nclassrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at Harry, or \\r\\ndoubled back to pass Harry in the corridors again, \\r\\nstaring. Harry wished People lining up outside \\r\\nclassrooms wouldn’t, because Harry was \\r\\ntrying to concentrate on finding Harry way to classes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at \\r\\nHogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; \\r\\nsome that led somewhere different on a Friday; some \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 147 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwith a vanishing step halfway up that you had to \\r\\nremember to jump. Then there were doors that \\r\\nwouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled \\r\\ndoors that \\r\\nwouldn’t open unless you asked politely in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t \\r\\nreally doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It \\r\\nwas also very hard to remember where anything was, \\r\\nbecause it all seemed to move around a lot. The \\r\\npeople in the portraits kept going to visit each other, \\r\\nand Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty \\r\\nshock when one of The ghosts glided suddenly through a \\r\\ndoor you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick \\r\\nwas always happy to point new Gryffindors in the \\r\\nright direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth \\r\\ntwo locked doors and a trick staircase if you met Nick \\r\\n \\r\\nwhen you were late for class. Nick \\r\\n would drop \\r\\nwastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from \\r\\nunder your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak \\r\\nup behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \\r\\n“GOT YOUR CONK!” \\r\\n\\r\\nEven worse than Peeves the Poltergeist, if that was possible, was the \\r\\ncaretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get \\r\\non the wrong side of Harry on Harry and Ron very first morning. \\r\\nArgus Filch found Harry and Ron trying to force Harry and Ron way through a \\r\\ndoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to \\r\\nthe out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. Argus Filch \\r\\nwouldn’t believe Harry and Ron were lost, was sure Harry and Ron were \\r\\ntrying to break into it on purpose, and was \\r\\nthreatening to lock Harry and Ron in the dungeons when Harry and Ron \\r\\nwere rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. \\r\\n\\r\\nArgus Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust- \\r\\ncolored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like \\r\\nFilch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule \\r\\nin front of She, put just one toe out of line, and she’d \\r\\nwhisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two \\r\\nseconds later. Argus Filch knew the secret passageways of \\r\\nPage | 148 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe school \\r\\n better than anyone (except perhaps the \\r\\nWeasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any \\r\\nof The ghosts. The students all hated anyone (except perhaps the \\r\\nWeasley twins), and it was \\r\\nthe dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a \\r\\ngood kick. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there \\r\\nwere the classes themselves. There was a lot more to \\r\\nmagic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving his wand and saying a few funny words. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey had to study the night skies through They \\r\\ntelescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn \\r\\nthe names of different stars and the movements of the \\r\\nplanets. Three times a week They went out to the \\r\\ngreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, \\r\\nwith a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, \\r\\nwhere They learned how to take care of all the strange \\r\\nplants and fungi, and found out what They were used \\r\\nfor. \\r\\n\\r\\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, \\r\\nwhich was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor \\r\\nBinns had been very old indeed when Professor \\r\\nBinns had fallen \\r\\nasleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next \\r\\nmorning to teach, leaving Professor \\r\\nBinns body behind Professor \\r\\nBinns. Professor \\r\\nBinnsdroned on and on while They scribbled down names \\r\\nand dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the \\r\\nOddball mixed up. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny \\r\\nlittle wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to \\r\\nsee over his desk. At the start of their first class his \\r\\ntook the roll call, and when his reached Harry’s name \\r\\nhis gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nBinns was again different. Harry had \\r\\nbeen quite right to think Professor \\r\\nBinns wasn’t a teacher to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 149 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncross. Strict and clever, Professor \\r\\nBinns gave Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncross a talking- to \\r\\nthe moment Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncross sat down in Professor \\r\\nBinns first class. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and \\r\\ndangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” Professor \\r\\nBinns \\r\\nsaid. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave \\r\\nand not come back. You have been warned.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThen Professor \\r\\nBinns changed his desk into a pig and back again. \\r\\nAnyone messing around in my class were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get \\r\\nstarted, but soon realized Anyone messing around in my class weren’t going to be \\r\\nchanging the furniture into animals for a long time. \\r\\nAfter taking a lot of complicated notes, Anyone messing around in my class were each \\r\\ngiven a match and started trying to turn a match into a \\r\\nneedle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione \\r\\nGranger had made any difference to only Hermione \\r\\nGranger match; \\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nBinns showed my class how my class had \\r\\ngone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare \\r\\nsmile. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to \\r\\nwas Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s \\r\\nlessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. Quirrell’s \\r\\n classroom \\r\\nsmelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to \\r\\nward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was \\r\\nafraid would be coming back to get Quirrell’s \\r\\n one of these \\r\\ndays. Quirrell’s \\r\\n , Quirrell’s \\r\\n told them, had been given to Quirrell’s \\r\\n \\r\\nby an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of \\r\\na troublesome zombie, but them weren’t sure them \\r\\nbelieved this story. For one thing, when Seamus \\r\\nFinnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had \\r\\nfought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started \\r\\ntalking about the weather; for another, them had \\r\\nnoticed that a funny smell hung around Quirrell’s turban, \\r\\nand the Weasley twins insisted that Quirrell was stuffed full \\r\\nof garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected \\r\\nwherever Quirrell went. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 150 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was very relieved to find out that Harry wasn’t \\r\\nmiles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come \\r\\nfrom Muggle families and, like Harry, hadn’t had any \\r\\nidea that Lots of people were witches and wizards. There was so \\r\\nmuch to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have \\r\\nmuch of a head start. \\r\\n\\r\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. Harry and Ron \\r\\nfinally managed to find Harry and Ron way down to the Great \\r\\nHall for breakfast without getting lost once. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as Ron \\r\\npoured sugar on Ron porridge. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. \\r\\n“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always \\r\\nfavors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Professor \\r\\nBinns favored us,” said Harry. Professor \\r\\nBinns was head of Gryffindor House, but Professor \\r\\nBinns \\r\\nhadn’t stopped Professor \\r\\nBinns from giving them a huge pile of \\r\\nhomework the day before. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to \\r\\nthis by now, but the mail had given Harry a bit of a shock on \\r\\nthe first morning, when about a hundred owls had \\r\\nsuddenly streamed into the Great Hall during \\r\\nbreakfast, circling the tables until about a hundred owls saw about a hundred owls \\r\\nowners, and dropping letters and packages onto about a hundred owls \\r\\nlaps. \\r\\n\\r\\nHedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. Hedwig \\r\\nsometimes flew in to nibble Harry ear and have a bit of \\r\\ntoast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the \\r\\nother school owls. This morning, however, She \\r\\nfluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar \\r\\nbowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harrytore Harry’s plate open at once. Harry said, in a very untidy scrawl: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 151 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Harry, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like \\r\\nto come and have a cup of tea with me around three? \\r\\n\\r\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an \\r\\nanswer back with Hedwig. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see \\r\\nyou later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off \\r\\nagain. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look \\r\\nforward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to \\r\\nbe the worst thing that had happened to Harry so far. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the \\r\\nidea that Professor Snape disliked Harry. By the end of \\r\\nthe first Potions lesson, Harry knew Harry’d been wrong. \\r\\nProfessor Snape didn’t dislike Harry — Professor Snape hated Harry —. \\r\\n\\r\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the \\r\\ndungeons. It was colder here than up in the main \\r\\ncastle, and would have been quite creepy enough \\r\\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all \\r\\naround the walls. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the \\r\\nroll call, and like Flitwick, Professor Snape paused at Harry’s name. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, yes,” Professor Snape said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — \\r\\ncelebrity.” \\r\\n\\r\\nDraco Malfoy and Draco Malfoy friends Crabbe and Goyle \\r\\nsniggered behind their hands. Professor Snape finished calling \\r\\nthe names and looked up at the class. Professor Snape eyes were \\r\\nblack like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 152 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwarmth. 152 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwarmth were cold and empty and made you \\r\\nthink of dark tunnels. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art \\r\\nof potion-making,” he began. he spoke in barely more \\r\\nthan a whisper, but 152 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwarmth caught every word — like \\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nBinns, Professor Snape had the gift of keeping a \\r\\nclass silent without effort. “As there is little foolish \\r\\nwand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe \\r\\nthis is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand \\r\\nthe beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its \\r\\nshimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that \\r\\ncreep through human veins, bewitching the mind, \\r\\nensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle \\r\\nfame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t \\r\\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to \\r\\nteach.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and \\r\\nRon exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. only Hermione \\r\\nGranger was on the edge of only Hermione \\r\\nGranger seat and looked \\r\\ndesperate to start proving that only Hermione \\r\\nGranger wasn’t a \\r\\ndunderhead. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry Potter!” said Professor Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I \\r\\nadded powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of \\r\\nwormwood?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harryglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as Harry was; \\r\\nHermione ’s hand had shot into the air. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” \\r\\n\\r\\nTut ignored Hermione ’s hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 153 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let’s try again. “Harry Potter, where would you look if I told \\r\\nyou to find me a bezoar?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione stretched Hermione hand as high into the air as it \\r\\nwould go without Hermione leaving her seat, but Harrydidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. Harrytried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who \\r\\nwere shaking with laughter. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know, sir.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, \\r\\neh, “Harry Potter?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry forced Harry to keep looking straight into \\r\\nthose cold eyes. Harry had looked through Harry books at \\r\\nthe Dursleys’, but did Professor Snape expect Professor Snape to remember \\r\\neverything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and \\r\\nFungi ? \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Snape was still ignoring ’s quivering hand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the difference, “Harry Potter, between monkshood \\r\\nand wolfsbane?” \\r\\n\\r\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, Hermione hand stretching \\r\\ntoward the dungeon ceiling. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” \\r\\n\\r\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, \\r\\nand Seamus winked. Professor Snape, however, was not \\r\\npleased. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sit down,” Professor Snape snapped at Hermione. “For your \\r\\ninformation, “Harry Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a \\r\\nsleeping potion so powerful a \\r\\nsleeping potion is known as the \\r\\nDraught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 154 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom the stomach of a goat and a goat will save you from \\r\\nmost poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they \\r\\nare the same plant, which also goes by the name of \\r\\naconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and \\r\\nparchment. Over the noise, Professor Snape said, “And a point \\r\\nwill be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, \\r\\nPotter.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThings didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the \\r\\nPotions lesson continued. Professor Snape put them all into \\r\\npairs and set \\r\\npairs to mixing up a simple potion to \\r\\ncure boils. Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, \\r\\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake \\r\\nfangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, \\r\\nwhom Professor Snape seemed to like. Professor Snape was just telling everyone \\r\\nto look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed Professor Snape \\r\\nhorned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a \\r\\nloud hissing filled the dungeon. Professor Snape had somehow \\r\\nmanaged to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted \\r\\nblob, and their potion was seeping across the stone \\r\\nfloor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within \\r\\nseconds, the whole class was standing on their stools \\r\\nwhile Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as \\r\\nangry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Idiot boy!” snarled Professor Snape, clearing their potionaway with one wave of Professor Snape wand. “I suppose you \\r\\nadded the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron \\r\\noff the fire?” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Snape whimpered as boils started to pop up all over \\r\\nProfessor Snape nose. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Take Professor Snape up to the hospital wing,” Professor Snape spat at \\r\\nSeamus. Then Professor Snape rounded on Harry and Ron, who \\r\\nhad been working next to Professor Snape. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 155 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell You — Potter — not to add \\r\\nthe porcupine quills? Thought You — Potter —’d make you look good if You — Potter — got \\r\\nit wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for \\r\\nGryffindor.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to \\r\\nargue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t push it,” Ron muttered, “I’ve heard Professor Snape can \\r\\nturn very nasty.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour \\r\\nlater, Harry’s mind was racing and Harry’s spirits were \\r\\nlow. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in Harry’s very \\r\\nfirst week — why did Professor Snape hate Professor Snape so much? \\r\\n\\r\\n“Cheer up,” said Ron, Seamus’s always taking points \\r\\noff Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid \\r\\nwith you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nAt five to three five to three left the main \\r\\ncastle and made five to three way \\r\\nacross the grounds. Hagrid \\r\\n lived in a small wooden \\r\\nhouse on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow \\r\\nand a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Harry knocked A crossbow \\r\\nand a pair of galoshes heard a frantic scrabbling \\r\\nfrom inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid \\r\\nvoice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry \\r\\npulled the door open. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hang on,” Harry said. “Back, Fang.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry let Back, Fang.” \\r\\n\\r\\n in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar \\r\\nof an enormous black boarhound. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants \\r\\nwere hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 156 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nboiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a \\r\\nmassive bed with a patchwork quilt over a \\r\\nmassive bed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid \\r\\n, letting go of \\r\\nFang, who bounded straight at Ron and started \\r\\nlicking Ron ears. Like Hagrid \\r\\n, Fang was clearly not as \\r\\nfierce as Fang looked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring \\r\\nboiling water into a large teapot and putting rock \\r\\ncakes onto a plate. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s \\r\\nfreckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers \\r\\naway from the forest.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins \\r\\nthat almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all \\r\\nabout Harry and Ron \\r\\n first lessons. Fang rested Fang head on \\r\\nHarry’s knee and drooled all over Fang robes. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry and Ron \\r\\n were delighted to hear Hagrid \\r\\n call \\r\\nFilch “that old git.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce \\r\\nher to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up \\r\\nter the school, her follows me everywhere? Can’t get \\r\\nrid of her puts her up to it.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry told Hagrid \\r\\n about Professor Snape’s lesson. Hagrid \\r\\n, like RonRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Professor Snapeliked hardly any of the students. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But Professor Snape seemed to really hate me.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Rubbish!” said Hagrid \\r\\n. “Why should Professor Snape?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 157 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid \\r\\n didn’t \\r\\nquite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid \\r\\n asked Ron. “I \\r\\nliked Ron a lot — great with animals.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid \\r\\n had changed the subject on \\r\\npurpose. While Ron told Hagrid \\r\\n all about Charlie’s \\r\\nwork with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper \\r\\nthat was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was \\r\\na cutting from the Daily Prophet : \\r\\n\\r\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST \\r\\n\\r\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts \\r\\non 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark \\r\\nwizards or witches unknown. \\r\\n\\r\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had \\r\\nbeen taken. The vault that was searched had in fact \\r\\nbeen emptied the same day. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep \\r\\nyour noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said \\r\\na Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry remembered Ron telling Harry on the train that \\r\\nsomeone had tried to rob Gringotts \\r\\n, but Ron hadn’t \\r\\nmentioned the date. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid \\r\\n!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in \\r\\nhappened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening \\r\\nwhile we were there!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no doubt about It, Hagrid \\r\\n definitely didn’t \\r\\nmeet Harry’s eyes this time. Harry grunted and offered \\r\\nHarry another rock cake. Harry read the story again. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe vault that was searched had in fact been emptied \\r\\nearlier that same day. Hagrid \\r\\n had emptied vault seven \\r\\nPage | 158 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nhundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, \\r\\ntaking out that grubby little package. Had that been \\r\\nwhat the thieves were looking for? \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Harry and Ron \\r\\n walked back to the main \\r\\ncastle for \\r\\ndinner, Harry and Ron \\r\\n pockets weighed down with rock cakes \\r\\nHarry and Ron \\r\\n’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that \\r\\nnone of the lessons he’d had so far had given Harry as \\r\\nmuch to think about as tea with Hagrid \\r\\n. Had Hagrid \\r\\ncollected that grubby little package just in time? Where was that grubby little package \\r\\nnow? And did Hagrid \\r\\n know something about Snape \\r\\nthat Snape \\r\\n didn’t want to tell Harry? \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 159 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had never believed Harry would meet a boy Harry \\r\\nhated more than Dudley, but that was before Harry met \\r\\nDraco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had \\r\\nPotions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put \\r\\nup with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until \\r\\nthey spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor \\r\\ncommon room that made them all groan. Flying \\r\\nlessons would be starting on Thursday — and \\r\\nGryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always \\r\\nwanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in \\r\\nfront of Malfoy.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had been looking forward to learning to fly more \\r\\nthan anything else. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” \\r\\nsaid Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always \\r\\ngoing on about how good Malfoy is at Quidditch, but I bet \\r\\nthatSeamus’s all talk.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 160 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. Malfoycomplained loudly about first years never getting on \\r\\nthe House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful \\r\\nstories that always seemed to end with Malfoy narrowly \\r\\nescaping Muggles in helicopters. Malfoy wasn’t the only \\r\\none, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, Malfoy’d \\r\\nspent most of Malfoy childhood zooming around the \\r\\ncountryside on a broomstick in \\r\\nfront of Malfoy. Even Ron would tell \\r\\nanyone who’d listen about the time Ron’d almost hit a \\r\\nhang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from \\r\\nwizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. \\r\\nRon had already had a big argument with Dean \\r\\nThomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. \\r\\nRon couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with \\r\\nonly one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harryhad caught Ron prodding Seamus’s poster of West Ham \\r\\nsoccer team, trying to make the players move. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Snape had never been on a broomstick in Professor Snape life, \\r\\nbecause Professor Snape grandmother had never let Professor Snape near one. \\r\\nPrivately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because \\r\\nProfessor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of \\r\\naccidents even with both feet on the ground. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about \\r\\nflying as Professor Snape was. This was something you couldn’t \\r\\nlearn by heart out of a book — not that Harry hadn’t \\r\\ntried. At breakfast on Thursday Harry bored them all \\r\\nstupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library \\r\\nbook called Quidditch Through the Ages. Professor Snape was \\r\\nhanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything \\r\\nthat might help him hang on to him later, \\r\\nbut everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s \\r\\nlecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, \\r\\nsomething that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of \\r\\ncourse. Charlie’s \\r\\n eagle owl was always bringing Malfoy ’s eagle owlPage | 161 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\npackages of sweets from home, which Harry opened \\r\\ngloatingly at the Slytherin table. \\r\\n\\r\\nA barn owl brought Professor Snape a small package from Professor Snape \\r\\ngrandmother. Professor Snape opened a small package from his \\r\\ngrandmother excitedly and showed \\r\\nthem a glass ball the size of a large marble, which \\r\\nseemed to be full of white smoke. \\r\\n\\r\\n“a small package from his \\r\\ngrandmother’s the \\r\\nRemembrall!” Professor Snape explained. “a small package from his \\r\\ngrandmother knows I \\r\\nforget things — this tells you if there’s something \\r\\nyou’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this \\r\\nand if this \\r\\n turns red — oh ...” Professor Snape face fell, because the \\r\\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “... you’ve \\r\\nforgotten something ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Snape was trying to remember what Professor Snape’d forgotten \\r\\nwhen Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor \\r\\ntable, snatched the \\r\\nRemembrall out of Professor Snape hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry and Ron \\r\\n jumped to Harry and Ron \\r\\n feet. Harry and Ron \\r\\n were half \\r\\nhoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any \\r\\nteacher in the school, was there in a flash. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s going on?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” \\r\\n\\r\\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the \\r\\nRemembrallback on the table. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with \\r\\nCrabbe and Goyle behind he. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the \\r\\nother Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto \\r\\nthe grounds for Ron, and the \\r\\nother Gryffindors first flying lesson. It was a clear, \\r\\nbreezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as \\r\\ntheir marched down the sloping lawns toward a \\r\\nPage | 162 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsmooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds \\r\\nto the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying \\r\\ndarkly in the distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty \\r\\nbroomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harryhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about \\r\\nthe school brooms, saying that some of Fred and George Weasley started \\r\\nto vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly \\r\\nto the left. \\r\\n\\r\\nFred and George Weasley teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, \\r\\ngray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what are you all waiting for?” She barked. \\r\\n“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry \\r\\nup.” \" \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry glanced down at Harry broom. It was old and \\r\\nsome of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Stick out your right hand over his broom,” called \\r\\nMadam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“UP!” everyone shouted. \\r\\n\\r\\nhis broom jumped into Harry hand at once, but his broom \\r\\nwas one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had \\r\\nsimply rolled over on the ground, and Hermione Granger’s hadn’t \\r\\nmoved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell \\r\\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a \\r\\nquaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that \\r\\nHarry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground. \\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount them \\r\\nbrooms without sliding off the end, and walked up \\r\\nand down the rows correcting them grips. Harry and \\r\\nRon were delighted when Madam Hooch told Malfoy Harry’d been \\r\\ndoing Malfoy wrong for years. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 163 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the \\r\\nground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep their \\r\\nbrooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight \\r\\nback down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle \\r\\n— three — two — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of \\r\\nbeing left on the ground, pushed off hard before the \\r\\nwhistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising \\r\\nstraight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve \\r\\nfeet — twenty feet. Harry saw Harry scared white face \\r\\nlook down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, \\r\\nslip sideways off his broom and — \\r\\n\\r\\nWHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay \\r\\nfacedown on the grass in a heap. Harry broomstick was \\r\\nstill rising higher and higher, and started to drift \\r\\nlazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. \\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as \\r\\nwhite as Madam Hooch. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Broken wrist,” Harry heard Madam Hooch mutter. “Come on, \\r\\nboy — it’s all right, up you get.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Hooch turned to the rest of the class. \\r\\n\\r\\n“None of you is to move while I take boy to the \\r\\nhospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are \\r\\nor you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \\r\\n‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, \\r\\nhobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm \\r\\naround his. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 164 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner were Page | 164 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n out of earshot than Malfoy burst \\r\\ninto laughter. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you see his face, the great lump?” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Slytherins joined in. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy \\r\\nParkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought \\r\\nyou’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching \\r\\nsomething out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing \\r\\nLongbottom’s gran sent It’s that stupid thing \\r\\n.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe \\r\\nRemembrall glittered in the sun as It’s that stupid thing \\r\\n held the \\r\\nRemembrall up. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone \\r\\nstopped talking to watch. \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy smiled nastily. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find \\r\\n— how about — up a tree?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto \\r\\nHarry broomstick and taken off. Harry hadn’t been lying, Harry \\r\\ncould fly well. Hovering level with the topmost \\r\\nbranches of an oak Harry called, “Come and get Hovering level with the topmost \\r\\nbranches of an oak he called, \\r\\nPotter!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry grabbed his broom. \\r\\n\\r\\n“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told \\r\\nus not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry ignored Madam Hooch. Blood was pounding in Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry ears. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry mounted his broom and kicked hard against the \\r\\nground and up, up Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry soared; air rushed through Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry \\r\\nhair, and Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry — and in \\r\\na rush of fierce joy Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry realized Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’d found something \\r\\nPage | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry could do without being taught — this was easy, \\r\\nthis was wonderful. Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry pulled Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry up a \\r\\nlittle to take \\r\\nhis broomstick even higher, and heard screams and \\r\\ngasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring \\r\\nwhoop from Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry turned Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry sharply to face Malfoy in \\r\\nmidair. Malfoy looked stunned. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off his broom!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking \\r\\nworried. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. Harry leaned forward \\r\\nand grasped his broom tightly in both hands, and his broom \\r\\nshot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got \\r\\nout of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- \\r\\nface and held the broom steady. A few people below \\r\\nwere clapping. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, \\r\\nMalfoy,” Harry called. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Catch it if you can, then!” Harry shouted, and Harry threw \\r\\nthe glass ball high into the air and streaked back \\r\\ntoward the ground. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the glass ball high into the air rise up \\r\\nin the air and then start to fall. Harry leaned forward \\r\\nand pointed his broom handle down — next second \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 166 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball \\r\\n— wind whistled in Harry ears, mingled with the \\r\\nscreams of people watching — Harry stretched out Harry \\r\\nhand — a foot from the ground Harry caught a foot, just in \\r\\ntime to pull his broom straight, and Harry toppled gently \\r\\nonto the grass with the \\r\\nRemembrall clutched safely in \\r\\nHarry fist. \\r\\n\\r\\n“HARRY POTTER!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry heart sank faster than Harry’d just dived. Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall was running toward them. Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall got to Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall \\r\\nfeet, trembling. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall was almost speechless with \\r\\nshock, and Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare \\r\\nyou — might have broken your neck — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It wasn’t Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall fault, Professor — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But Malfoy — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s enough, George Weasley. Harry Potter, follow me, now.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s \\r\\ntriumphant faces as Harry left, walking numbly in \\r\\nHermione Granger’s wake as Hermione Granger’s strode toward the \\r\\ncastle. Hermione Granger’s was going to be expelled, Hermione Granger’s just knew it. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione Granger’s wanted to say something to defend Hermione Granger’s, but \\r\\nthere seemed to be something wrong with Hermione Granger’s voice. \\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall was sweeping along without \\r\\neven looking at Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall; Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall had to jog to keep up. Now \\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall’d done it. Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be \\r\\npacking Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall bags in ten minutes. What would the \\r\\nDursleys say when Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall turned up on the doorstep? \\r\\nPage | 167 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, \\r\\nand still Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall didn’t say a word to \\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall. Hermione Granger’s wrenched open doors and marched along \\r\\ncorridors with Harry trotting miserably behind Hermione Granger’s. \\r\\nMaybe Hermione Granger’s was taking Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall to Dumbledore. Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall \\r\\nthought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as \\r\\ngamekeeper. Perhaps Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall could be Hermione Granger’s assistant. \\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall stomach twisted as Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall imagined it, watching Ronand the others becoming wizards while Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall stumped \\r\\naround the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall stopped outside a classroom. \\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall opened the door and poked Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall head inside. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood \\r\\nfor a moment?Wood \\r\\n? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane \\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall was going to use on Harry? \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Wood \\r\\n turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year \\r\\nboy who came out of Professor Flitwick’s class looking \\r\\nconfused. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Follow me, you two,” said Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall, and \\r\\nthey marched on up the corridor, Wood \\r\\n looking \\r\\ncuriously at Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“In here.” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall pointed they into a classroom \\r\\nthat was empty except for Peeves, who was busy \\r\\nwriting rude words on the blackboard. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Out, Peeves!” Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall barked. Peeves threw the chalk \\r\\ninto a bin, which clanged loudly, and Peeves swooped out \\r\\ncursing. Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall slammed the door \\r\\nbehind Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall and turned to face the two boys. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 168 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter, this is Wood \\r\\n. Wood — I’ve found you a \\r\\nSeeker.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWood \\r\\n’s expression changed from puzzlement to \\r\\ndelight. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you serious, Professor \\r\\n?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Absolutely,” said Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall crisply. “The \\r\\nboy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like The \\r\\nboy’s a natural. Was \\r\\nthat your first time on a broomstick, Harry Potter?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry nodded silently. Harry didn’t have a clue what was \\r\\ngoing on, but Harry didn’t seem to be being expelled, and \\r\\nsome of the feeling started coming back to Harry legs. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry caught that thing in Harry hand after a fifty-foot \\r\\ndive,” Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall told Wood \\r\\n. “Didn’t even \\r\\nscratch Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done \\r\\nit.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWood \\r\\n was now looking as though all Charlie Weasley dreams had \\r\\ncome true at once. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Harry Potter?” Charlie Weasley asked \\r\\nexcitedly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall explained. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Charlie Weasley’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now \\r\\nwalking around Harry and staring at Harry. “Light — \\r\\nspeedy — we’ll have to get Harry a decent broom, \\r\\nProfessor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a \\r\\nCleansweep Seven, I’d say.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall speak to Dumbledore and see if we \\r\\ncan’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need \\r\\na better team than last year. Flattened in that last \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 169 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmatch by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in \\r\\nthe face for weeks. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor \\r\\nMcGonagall peered sternly over Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall glasses \\r\\nat Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to hear you’re training hard, Harry Potter, or I may \\r\\nchange my mind about punishing you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThen Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall suddenly smiled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Your father would have been proud,” Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall said. “Your father \\r\\nwas an excellent Quidditch player himself.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re joking.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ronwhat had happened when Harry’d left the grounds with Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and \\r\\nkidney pie halfway to Ron mouth, but Ron’d forgotten all \\r\\nabout a piece of steak. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Seeker?” Ron said. “But first years never — you must \\r\\nbe the youngest House player in about — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. Harry felt particularly hungry after the \\r\\nexcitement of the afternoon. “Wood \\r\\n told me.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, Ron just sat and \\r\\ngaped at Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t \\r\\ntell anyone, Wood \\r\\n wants to keep Wood \\r\\n a secret.” \\r\\n\\r\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, \\r\\nspotted Harry, and hurried over. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 170 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood \\r\\n told Fred and George Weasley. \\r\\nFred and George Weasley’re on the Gryffindor team too — Beaters.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you, Fred and George Weasley’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for \\r\\nsure this year,” said Fred. “Fred and George Weasley haven’t won since \\r\\nCharlie Weasley left, but this year’s team is going to be \\r\\nbrilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood \\r\\n was almost \\r\\nskipping when Wood \\r\\n told Fred and George Weasley.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Anyway, Fred and George Weasley’ve got to go, Wood \\r\\n reckons Wood \\r\\nThe \\r\\nboy’s a naturalfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the \\r\\nSmarmy that we found in we first week. See you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nFred and George Weasley George had hardly disappeared when \\r\\nsomeone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked \\r\\nby Crabbe and Goyle. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Having a last meal, Harry Potter? When are you getting the \\r\\ntrain back to the Muggles?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the \\r\\nground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” \\r\\nsaid Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all \\r\\nlittle about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table \\r\\nwas full of teachers, neither of teachers could do more \\r\\nthan crack teachers knuckles and scowl. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. \\r\\n“Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — \\r\\nno contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a \\r\\nWizard’s duel before, I suppose?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m \\r\\nhe second, who’s yours?” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing Crabbe and Goyle up. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 171 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? Well meet you \\r\\nin the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each \\r\\nother. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do \\r\\nyou mean, you’re my second?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said \\r\\nRon casually, getting started at last on Ron cold pie. \\r\\nCatching the look on Harry’s face, Harry added quickly, \\r\\n“But people only die in proper duels, you know, with \\r\\nreal wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do \\r\\nis send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows \\r\\nenough magic to do any real damage. I bet Harry \\r\\nexpected you to refuse, anyway.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Throw it away and punch ” \\r\\n\\r\\n on the nose,” Ronsuggested. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione ignored Ron and spoke to Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoywere saying — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bet you could,” Ron muttered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school \\r\\nat night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 172 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nyou’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very \\r\\nselfish of you.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And It’s really none of your business,” said Harry. \\r\\n“Good-bye,” said Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end \\r\\nto the day, Harry thought, as Harry lay awake much later \\r\\nlistening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville \\r\\nwasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent \\r\\nall evening giving Ron advice such as “If Ron tries to \\r\\ncurse you, you’d better dodge he tries to \\r\\ncurse you, because I can’t \\r\\nremember how to block he tries to \\r\\ncurse you.” There was a very good \\r\\nchance he tries to \\r\\ncurse you were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. \\r\\nNorris, and Harry felt Harry was pushing Harry luck, \\r\\nbreaking another school rule today. On the other \\r\\nhand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of \\r\\nthe darkness — this was his big chance to beat \\r\\nMalfoy face-to-face. his couldn’t miss it. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better \\r\\ngo.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey pulled on They bathrobes, picked up They \\r\\nwands, and crept across the tower room, down the \\r\\nspiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common \\r\\nroom. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, \\r\\nturning all the armchairs into hunched black \\r\\nshadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole \\r\\nwhen a voice spoke from the chair nearest They, “I \\r\\ncan’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA lamp flickered on. A lamp was Hermione Granger, \\r\\nwearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 173 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, \\r\\n\\r\\n“Percy — your brother’s a prefect, your brother’d put a stop to this.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on,” Harry said to Ron. Harry pushed open the \\r\\nportrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the portrait hole \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. Hermione \\r\\nfollowed Ron through the portrait hole \\r\\n, hissing at \\r\\nthem like an angry goose. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care \\r\\nabout yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the \\r\\nHouse Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall for knowing about Switching \\r\\nSpells.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Go away.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what \\r\\nI said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, \\r\\nyou’re so — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermionehad turned to the \\r\\nportrait of the Fat Lady the Fat Lady to get back \\r\\ninside and found Hermione facing an empty painting. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and \\r\\nHermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now what am I going to do?” the Fat Lady asked shrilly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, \\r\\nWe’re going to be late.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor \\r\\nwhen Hermione caught up with They. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m coming with the Fat Lady,” the Fat Lady said. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 174 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are not.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for \\r\\nFilch to catch me? If Filch finds all three of us I’ll tell \\r\\nFilch the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you \\r\\ncan back me up.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard \\r\\nsomething.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sort of snuffling. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the \\r\\ndark. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville \\r\\n. Neville \\r\\n was curled up \\r\\non the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake \\r\\nas they crept nearer. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for \\r\\nhours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get \\r\\nin to bed.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep your voice down, Neville \\r\\n. The password’s ‘Pig \\r\\nsnout’ but Pig \\r\\n won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone \\r\\noff somewhere.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“How’s your arm?” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Fine,” said Neville \\r\\n, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey \\r\\nmended it in about a minute.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good — well, look, Neville \\r\\n, we’ve got to be \\r\\nsomewhere, we’ll see you later — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 175 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t leave me!” said Neville \\r\\n, scrambling to Neville \\r\\n feet, \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at \\r\\nHermione and Neville. \\r\\n\\r\\n“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve \\r\\nlearned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us \\r\\nabout, and used it on you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione opened Hermione mouth, perhaps to tell Ronexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harryhissed at Hermione to be quiet and beckoned them all \\r\\nforward. \\r\\n\\r\\nthem all \\r\\n flitted along corridors striped with bars of \\r\\nmoonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harryexpected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but them all \\r\\n \\r\\nwere lucky. them all \\r\\n sped up a staircase to the third floor \\r\\nand tiptoed toward the trophy room. \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal \\r\\ntrophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught \\r\\nMalfoy and Crabbe. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver \\r\\nand gold in the darkness. Malfoy and Crabbe edged along the walls, \\r\\nkeeping Malfoy and Crabbe eyes on the doors at either end of the \\r\\nroom. Harry took out Harry wand in case Malfoy leapt in \\r\\nand started at once. The minutes crept by. \\r\\n\\r\\n“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen a noise in the \\r\\nroom made them jump. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had only just raised his wand when them heard \\r\\nsomeone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sniff around, my sweet, “Sniff around, my sweet might be lurking in a \\r\\ncorner.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 176 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris?”. Horror-struck, \\r\\nHarry waved madly at the other three to follow Harry as \\r\\nquickly as possible; “Sniff around, my sweet scurried silently toward the \\r\\ndoor, away from the Fat Lady’s voice. the Fat Lady’s robes had \\r\\nbarely whipped round a \\r\\ncorner when Neville’s robes heard \\r\\nFilch enter the trophy room. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Neville’s robes’re in here somewhere,” Neville’s robes heard Harry mutter, \\r\\n“probably hiding.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, \\r\\npetrified, the others began to creep down a long gallery full \\r\\nof suits of armor. the others could hear Filch getting \\r\\nnearer. Neville \\r\\n suddenly let out a frightened squeak \\r\\nand broke into a run — Neville \\r\\n tripped, grabbed Ronaround the waist, and the pair of Neville’s robes toppled right \\r\\ninto a suit of armor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the \\r\\nwhole castle. \\r\\n\\r\\n“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted \\r\\ndown a long gallery full \\r\\nof suits of armor, not looking back to see whether \\r\\nFilch was following — they swung around the \\r\\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then \\r\\nanother, Harry in the lead, without any idea where \\r\\nthey were or where they were going — they ripped \\r\\nthrough a tapestry and found they in a hidden \\r\\npassageway, hurtled along a hidden \\r\\npassageway and came out near they \\r\\nCharms classroom, which they knew was miles from \\r\\nthe trophy room. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against \\r\\nthe cold wall and wiping him forehead. Neville \\r\\n was \\r\\nbent double, wheezing and spluttering. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the \\r\\nstitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 177 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, \\r\\n“quickly as possible.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You \\r\\nrealize that, don’t you? Harry was never going to meet \\r\\nyou Filch knew someone was going to be in the \\r\\ntrophy room, Malfoy must have tipped someone off.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry thought Harry was probably right, but Harry wasn’t \\r\\ngoing to tell Harry that. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Let’s go.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone \\r\\nmore than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled \\r\\nand something came shooting out of a classroom in \\r\\nfront of They. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Peeves. Harry caught sight of They and gave a \\r\\nsqueal of delight. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown \\r\\nout.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPeeves cackled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, \\r\\ntut, Tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity \\r\\nvoice, but Peeves eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your \\r\\nown good, you know.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at \\r\\nPeeves — this was a big mistake. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 178 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, \\r\\n“STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS \\r\\nCORRIDOR!” \\r\\n\\r\\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for they lives, right \\r\\nto the end of the corridor where they slammed into a \\r\\ndoor — and it was locked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at \\r\\nthe door, “We’re done for! This is the end!” \\r\\n\\r\\nthey could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as Filch \\r\\ncould toward the Fat Lady’s shouts. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed \\r\\nHarry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \\r\\n“Alohomora\\\\” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe lock clicked and the door swung open — they \\r\\npiled through the lock, shut the lock quickly, and pressed they \\r\\nears against the lock, listening. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. \\r\\n“Quick, tell me.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Say ‘please.’ ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said \\r\\nPeeves in his annoying singsong voice. \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right — please.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing \\r\\nif you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they \\r\\nheard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filchcursing in rage. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 179 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Page | 179 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n thinks the door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I \\r\\nthink well be okay — get off Neville \\r\\n!” For Neville \\r\\n had \\r\\nbeen tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the \\r\\nlast minute. “What?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. \\r\\nFor a moment, Harry was sure Harry’d walked into a \\r\\nnightmare — this was too much, on top of everything \\r\\nthat had happened so far. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey weren’t in a room, as Harry had supposed. They \\r\\nwere in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third \\r\\nfloor. And now They knew why The forbidden corridor on the third \\r\\nfloor was forbidden. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a \\r\\nmonstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space \\r\\nbetween ceiling and floor. The forbidden corridor on the third \\r\\nfloor had three heads. Three \\r\\npairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and \\r\\nquivering in They direction; three drooling mouths, \\r\\nsaliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at They, \\r\\nand Harry knew that the only reason They weren’t \\r\\nalready dead was that They sudden appearance had \\r\\ntaken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over \\r\\nthat, there was no mistaking what those thunderous \\r\\ngrowls meant. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and \\r\\ndeath, Harry’d take Filch. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey fell backward Harry Harry slammed the door shut, \\r\\nand They ran, They almost flew, back down a corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for They \\r\\nsomewhere else, because They didn’t see Filch \\r\\nanywhere, but they did hardly cared — all they did wanted to \\r\\ndo was put as much space as possible between they did \\r\\nand that monster. they did didn’t stop running until they did \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 180 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nreached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh \\r\\nfloor. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where on earth have you all been?” the Fat Lady asked, \\r\\nlooking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders \\r\\nand their flushed, sweaty faces. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted \\r\\nHarry, and the portrait swung forward. They \\r\\nscrambled into the common room and collapsed, \\r\\ntrembling, into armchairs. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a while before any of They said anything. \\r\\nNeville \\r\\n, indeed, looked as if Neville \\r\\n’d never speak again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing \\r\\nlike that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If \\r\\nany dog needs exercise, that one does.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione had got both Hermione breath and Hermione bad \\r\\ntemper back again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” Hermione \\r\\nsnapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at it \\r\\nfeet, I was too busy with it .” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, not the floor. not the floor was standing on a trapdoor. not the floorthe Fat Lady’sobviously guarding something.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione stood up, glaring at them. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all \\r\\nhave been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you \\r\\ndon’t mind, I’m going to bed.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon stared after Hermione, Ron mouth open. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 181 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, We don’t mind,” Ron said. “You’d think We dragged \\r\\nHermione along, wouldn’t you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to \\r\\nthink about as Ron climbed back into bed. The dog was \\r\\nguarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? \\r\\nGringotts was the safest place in the world for \\r\\nsomething you wanted to hide — except perhaps \\r\\nHogwarts. \\r\\n\\r\\nGringotts looked as though Harry had found out where the \\r\\ngrubby little package from vault seven hundred and \\r\\nthirteen was. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 182 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy couldn’t believe 10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy eyes when 10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy saw that \\r\\nHarry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, \\r\\nlooking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the \\r\\nnext morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting \\r\\nthe three-headed dog had been an excellent \\r\\nadventure, and Harry and Ron were quite keen to have another \\r\\none. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the \\r\\npackage that seemed to have been moved from \\r\\nGringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time \\r\\nwondering what could possibly need such heavy \\r\\nprotection. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said \\r\\nRon. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Or both,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious \\r\\nobject was that it was about two inches long, they \\r\\ndidn’t have much chance of guessing what it was \\r\\nwithout further clues. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 183 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest \\r\\ninterest in what lay underneath the dog and the \\r\\ntrapdoor. All Neville \\r\\n cared about was never going near \\r\\nThe dog again. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and \\r\\nRon, but Hermione was such a bossy know-it-all that Harry and \\r\\nRon \\r\\nsaw this as an added bonus. All Harry and \\r\\nRon really wanted \\r\\nnow was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to Harry and \\r\\nRon \\r\\ngreat delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail \\r\\nabout a week later. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, \\r\\neveryone’s attention was caught at once by a long, \\r\\nthin package carried by six large screech owls. Harrywas just as interested as everyone else to see what \\r\\nwas in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped this large parcel right in front of Harry, \\r\\nknocking Harry bacon to the third \\r\\nfloor. the owls had hardly \\r\\nfluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a \\r\\nletter on top of this large parcel. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, \\r\\nbecause it said: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDO NOT OPEN this large parcel AT THE TABLE. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis large parcel contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I \\r\\ndon’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a \\r\\nbroomstick or the owls’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will \\r\\nmeet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven \\r\\no’clock for your first training session. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Harry had difficulty hiding Harry glee as Harry handed the \\r\\nnote to Ron to read. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 184 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. \\r\\n“I’ve never even touched one.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey left the Great Hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the \\r\\nbroomstick in private before They first class, but \\r\\nhalfway across the entrance hall They found the way \\r\\nupstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. 10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy seized \\r\\nthe package from Harry and felt the package from Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a broomstick,” That’s a broomstick said, throwing the package from Harry back to Harry Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on Harry face. \\r\\n“You’ll be in for it this time, Harry Potter, first years aren’t \\r\\nallowed Harry Potter.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon couldn’t resist it. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not any old broomstick,” It’s not any old broomstick said, “It’s a Nimbus \\r\\nTwo Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, \\r\\nMalfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. \\r\\n“Comets look flashy, but Comets’re not in the same \\r\\nleague as the Nimbus.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What would you know about it, Weasley, you \\r\\ncouldn’t afford half the handle,” 10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy snapped back. \\r\\n“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up \\r\\ntwig by twig.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared \\r\\nat 10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy’s elbow. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” Ron squeaked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said \\r\\n10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy quickly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, \\r\\nbeaming at Harry. “Professor Flitwick told me all \\r\\nabout the special circumstances, Harry Potter. And what \\r\\nmodel is it?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 185 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting \\r\\nnot to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. \\r\\n“And it’s really thanks to 10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy here that I’ve got it,” \\r\\n10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy added. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering Harry and Ron \\r\\nlaughter at 10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHALLOWEEN \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy obvious rage and confusion. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the \\r\\ntop of the marble staircase, “If Harry hadn’t stolen \\r\\nNeville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking \\r\\nrules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. \\r\\nHermione was stomping up the stairs, looking \\r\\ndisapprovingly at the package from Harry in Harry’s hand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so \\r\\nmuch good.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping Harry mind on Harry \\r\\nlessons that day. It kept wandering up to the \\r\\ndormitory where Harry new broomstick was lying under \\r\\nHarry bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where \\r\\nHarry’d be learning to play that night. Harry bolted Harry \\r\\ndinner that evening without noticing what Harry was \\r\\neating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap \\r\\nthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wow,” Ron sighed, as his new broomstick rolled onto \\r\\nHarry’s bedspread. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different \\r\\nbrooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and \\r\\nshiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 186 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nneat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand \\r\\nwritten in gold near the top. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and \\r\\nset off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d \\r\\nnever been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of \\r\\nseats were raised in stands around the Quidditch field so that \\r\\nthe spectators were high enough to see what was \\r\\ngoing on. At either end of the Quidditch field were three golden \\r\\npoles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harrythe little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles \\r\\nthrough, except that They were fifty feet high. \\r\\n\\r\\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harrymounted his new broomstick and kicked off from the \\r\\nground. What a feeling — Harry swooped in and out of \\r\\nthe goal posts and then sped up and down the Quidditch field. \\r\\nThe Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever Harry \\r\\nwanted at Harry lightest touch. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, Harry Potter, come down!” \\r\\n\\r\\nOliver Wood had arrived. Oliver Wood was carrying a large \\r\\nwooden crate under Oliver Wood arm. Harry landed next to \\r\\nOliver Wood. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Very nice,” said Wood, Oliver Wood eyes glinting. “I see what \\r\\nMcGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I’m \\r\\njust going to teach you the rules this evening, then \\r\\nyou’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMcGonagall opened a large \\r\\nwooden crate. Inside were four different-sized \\r\\nballs. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Right,” said Oliver Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to \\r\\nunderstand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are \\r\\nseven players on each side. Three of them are called \\r\\nChasers.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 187 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Oliver Wood took out a \\r\\nbright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \\r\\n\\r\\n“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Oliver Wood. “The \\r\\nChasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and \\r\\nget the Quaffle through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten \\r\\npoints every time the Quaffle goes through one of the \\r\\nhoops. Follow me?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“The \\r\\nChasers throw the Quaffle and put the Quaffle through \\r\\nthe hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of \\r\\nlike basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t \\r\\nit?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s basketball?” said Oliver Wood curiously. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” said Harry quickly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called \\r\\nthe Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly \\r\\naround our hoops and stop the other team from \\r\\nscoring.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was \\r\\ndetermined to remember it all. “And they play with \\r\\nthe Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He \\r\\npointed at the three balls left inside the box. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll show you now,” said Oliver Wood. “Take this.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short \\r\\nbaseball bat. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Oliver Woodsaid. “These two are the Bludgers.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and \\r\\nslightly smaller than \\r\\nthe Quaffle. Harry noticed \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 188 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthat they seemed to be straining to escape the straps \\r\\nholding they inside the box. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. Harry bent down and \\r\\nfreed one of the Bludgers. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then \\r\\npelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at Harry’s face with \\r\\nthe bat to stop Harry’s face from breaking Harry nose, and sent Harry’s face \\r\\nzigzagging away into the air — Harry’s face zoomed around their \\r\\nheads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of Harry’s face \\r\\nand managed to pin Harry’s face to the ground. \\r\\n\\r\\n“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger \\r\\nback into a large \\r\\nwooden crate and strapping a large \\r\\nwooden crate down safely. “The \\r\\nBludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off \\r\\ntheir brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on \\r\\neach team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s the Weasley twinsjob to protect the Weasley twins side from the Bludgers and try and \\r\\nknock the Weasley twins toward the other team. So — think you’ve \\r\\ngot all that?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Three The \\r\\nChasers try and score with the Quaffle; the \\r\\nKeeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep The \\r\\nBludgers away from the Beaters ,” Harry reeled off. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good,” said Oliver Wood. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harryasked, hoping Harry sounded offhand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken \\r\\njaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last \\r\\nmember of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And \\r\\nyou don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or The \\r\\nBludgers — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“ — unless they crack my head open.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 189 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for \\r\\nthe Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of the Bludgers.” \\r\\n\\r\\nOliver Wood reached into a large \\r\\nwooden crate and took out the fourth \\r\\nand last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and The \\r\\nBludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. \\r\\nit was bright gold and had little fluttering silver \\r\\nwings. \\r\\n\\r\\n“This,” said Oliver Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and This’s the \\r\\nmost important ball of the lot. This’s very hard to catch \\r\\nbecause This’s so fast and difficult to see. This’s the \\r\\nSeeker’s job to catch This. You’ve got to weave in and out \\r\\nof the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get \\r\\nit before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever \\r\\nSeeker catches the Golden Snitch wins the Golden Snitch team an extra \\r\\nhundred and fifty points, so the Golden Snitch nearly always win. \\r\\nThat’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Golden Snitch is caught, so the Golden Snitch \\r\\ncan go on for ages — I think the record is three \\r\\nmonths, the Golden Snitch had to keep bringing on substitutes so \\r\\nthe players could get some sleep. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s it — any questions?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry shook Harry head. Harry understood what Harry had to \\r\\ndo all right, it was doing it that was going to be the \\r\\nproblem. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We won’t practice with the Golden Snitch yet,” said Wood, \\r\\ncarefully shutting Wood back inside a large \\r\\nwooden crate, “Wood’s too \\r\\ndark, we might lose Wood. Let’s try you out with a few of \\r\\nthese.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of Harry pocket \\r\\nand a few minutes later, Harry and Harry were up in the \\r\\nair, Oliver Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as Harry could \\r\\nin every direction for Harry to catch. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 190 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry didn’t miss a single one, and Oliver Wood was \\r\\ndelighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen \\r\\nand he and Harry couldn’t carry on. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” \\r\\nsaid Oliver Wood happily as Oliver Wood trudged back up to the \\r\\ncastle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better \\r\\nthan Charlie Weasley, and Charlie Weasley could have played for \\r\\nEngland if Charlie Weasley hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was because Charlie Weasley was now so busy, what \\r\\nwith Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top \\r\\nof all Charlie Weasley homework, but Harry could hardly believe it \\r\\nwhen Charlie Weasley realized that Charlie Weasley’d already been at Hogwarts \\r\\ntwo months. the castle felt more like home than \\r\\nPrivet Drive ever had. Charlie Weasley lessons, too, were becoming \\r\\nmore and more interesting now that they had \\r\\nmastered the basics. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious \\r\\nsmell of baking pumpkin wafting through the \\r\\ncorridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced \\r\\nin Charms that Professor Flitwick thought they were ready to start \\r\\nmaking objects fly, something they had all been dying \\r\\nto try since they’d seen Professor Flitwick make Neville’s toad zoom \\r\\naround the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the \\r\\nclass into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was \\r\\nSeamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville \\r\\nhad been trying to catch Neville \\r\\n eye). Neville \\r\\n, however, was \\r\\nto be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to \\r\\ntell whether Neville \\r\\n or Hermione was angrier about this. \\r\\nHermione hadn’t spoken to either of Ron or Hermione was angrier about this since the day \\r\\nHarry’s broomstick had arrived. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve \\r\\nbeen practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, \\r\\nperched on top of Professor Flitwick pile of books as usual. “Swish \\r\\nand flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the \\r\\nmagic words properly is very important, too — never \\r\\nPage | 191 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nforget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f and \\r\\nfound himself on the floor with a buffalo on himself \\r\\nchest.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and \\r\\nflicked, but the feather Harry and Seamus were supposed to be \\r\\nsending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got \\r\\nso impatient that himself prodded the desktop with himself wand and set \\r\\nfire to the desktop — Harry had to put the desktop out with Harry hat. \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville \\r\\n, at the next table, wasn’t having much more \\r\\nluck. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wingardium Leviosal” Wingardium Leviosal shouted, waving Wingardium Leviosal long \\r\\narms like a windmill. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. \\r\\n“it’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and \\r\\nlong.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Neville \\r\\n snarled. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of Hermione gown, flicked \\r\\nhis wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wingardium LeviosaV rose off the desk and hovered about four \\r\\nfeet above “Wingardium LeviosaV heads. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \\r\\n“Everyone see here, It’s done it!” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville \\r\\n was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Neville \\r\\n said to Harry Harry as Harry pushed Harry way into the crowded \\r\\ncorridor, “Harry’s a nightmare, honestly.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 192 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past \\r\\nHarry. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of Harry \\r\\nface — and was startled to see that Harry was in tears. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think Harry heard you.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“So?” said Neville \\r\\n, but Neville \\r\\n looked a bit uncomfortable. \\r\\n“Harry must’ve noticed Harry’s got no friends.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t \\r\\nseen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great \\r\\nHall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Neville \\r\\n overheard \\r\\nParvati Patil telling Harry friend Lavender that Hermione \\r\\nwas crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be \\r\\nleft alone. Neville \\r\\n looked still more awkward at this, but \\r\\na moment later the girls had entered the Great Hall, \\r\\nwhere the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of \\r\\nthe girls minds. \\r\\n\\r\\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and \\r\\nceiling while a thousand more swooped over the \\r\\ntables in low black clouds, making the candles in the \\r\\npumpkins stutter. the Halloween feast appeared suddenly on \\r\\nthe golden plates, as the Halloween feast had at the start-of-term \\r\\nbanquet. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was just helping Harry to a baked potato \\r\\nwhen Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great \\r\\nHall, \\r\\nHarry turban askew and terror on Harry face. Everyone \\r\\nstared as Harry reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, \\r\\nslumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in \\r\\nthe dungeons — thought you ought to know.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry then sank to the floor in a dead faint. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an uproar. an uproar took several purple \\r\\nfirecrackers exploding from the end of Professor \\r\\nDumbledore’s wand to bring silence. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 193 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Prefects,” 193 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Prefects rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the \\r\\ndormitories immediately!” \\r\\n\\r\\nPercy was in Percy element. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear \\r\\nthe troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind \\r\\nme, now. Make way, first years coming through! \\r\\nExcuse me, I’m a prefect!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as a troll \\r\\nclimbed the stairs. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t ask me, a troll’re supposed to be really stupid,” \\r\\nsaid Neville \\r\\n. “Maybe Peeves let Peeves in for a Halloween \\r\\njoke.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in \\r\\ndifferent directions. As They jostled They way through \\r\\na crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly \\r\\ngrabbed Ron’s arm. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve just thought Hermione.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What about Hermione?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hermione doesn’t know about the troll.” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville \\r\\n bit Neville \\r\\n lip. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, all right,” Neville \\r\\n snapped. “But Percy’d better not \\r\\nsee us.” \\r\\n\\r\\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the \\r\\nother way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and \\r\\nhurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. they had just \\r\\nturned the corner when they heard quick footsteps \\r\\nbehind they. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 194 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Percy!” hissed Neville \\r\\n, pulling Harry behind a large \\r\\nstone griffin. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeering around a large \\r\\nstone griffin, however, 194 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Percy!” saw not Percy but \\r\\nSnape. Percy crossed a deserted side corridor and disappeared from \\r\\nview. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s Percy doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t Percy \\r\\ndown in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Search me.” \\r\\n\\r\\nQuietly as possible, Quietly crept along the next corridor \\r\\nafter Snape ’s fading footsteps. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Percy’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Neville \\r\\nheld up Percy hand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you smell something?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached Harry nostrils, a \\r\\nmixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no \\r\\none seems to clean. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then they heard no \\r\\none — a low grunting, and the \\r\\nshuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Neville \\r\\n pointed — at \\r\\nthe end of a passage to the left, something huge was \\r\\nmoving toward they. they shrank into the shadows \\r\\nand watched as the shadows \\r\\n emerged into a patch of moonlight. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe shadows \\r\\n was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, the shadows \\r\\n skin was a \\r\\ndull, granite gray, the shadows \\r\\n great lumpy body like a boulder \\r\\nwith the shadows \\r\\n small bald head perched on top like a \\r\\ncoconut. the shadows \\r\\n had short legs thick as tree trunks with \\r\\nflat, horny feet. The smell coming from the shadows \\r\\n was \\r\\nincredible. The smell coming from it was holding a huge wooden club, which \\r\\ndragged along the third floor because The smell coming from it arms were so long. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 195 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. \\r\\nthe troll waggled the troll long ears, making up the troll tiny mind, then \\r\\nslouched slowly into the room. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could \\r\\nlock the troll in.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good idea,” said Neville \\r\\n nervously. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe troll edged toward the open door, mouths dry, \\r\\npraying the troll wasn’t about to come out of the troll. With \\r\\none great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam \\r\\nthe door, and lock the key. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes!” \\r\\n\\r\\nFlushed with the troll victory, the troll started to run back \\r\\nup the passage, but as the troll reached the corner the troll \\r\\nheard something that made the troll hearts stop — a \\r\\nhigh, petrified scream — and it was coming from the \\r\\nchamber they’d just chained up. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no,” said Neville \\r\\n, pale as the Bloody Baron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Hermionel” Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron said together. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the last thing Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron wanted to do, but what \\r\\nchoice did Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron have? Wheeling around, Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron sprinted \\r\\nback to the door and turned the key, fumbling in Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron \\r\\npanic. Harry pulled the door open and Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron ran \\r\\ninside. \\r\\n\\r\\nGranger was shrinking against the wall \\r\\nopposite, looking as if Granger was about to faint. the trollwas advancing on Granger, knocking the sinks off the \\r\\nwalls as the troll went. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 196 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Neville \\r\\n, and, \\r\\nseizing a tap, Harry threw it as hard as Harry could against \\r\\nthe wall. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. the troll \\r\\nlumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had \\r\\nmade the noise. the troll mean little eyes saw Harry. the troll \\r\\nhesitated, then made for Harry instead, lifting the troll club \\r\\nas the troll went. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Neville \\r\\n from the other side of the \\r\\nchamber, and Neville \\r\\n threw a metal pipe at a metal pipe. the trolldidn’t even seem to notice a metal pipe hitting a metal pipe \\r\\nshoulder, but a metal pipe heard the yell and paused again, \\r\\nturning a metal pipe ugly snout toward Neville \\r\\n instead, giving \\r\\nHarry time to run around a metal pipe. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on, run, run\\\\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying \\r\\nto pull Hermione toward the door, but Hermione couldn’t move, \\r\\nHermione was still flat against the wall, Hermione mouth open \\r\\nwith terror. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the \\r\\ntroll berserk. the \\r\\ntroll berserk roared again and started toward Neville \\r\\n, \\r\\nwho was nearest and had no way to escape. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry then did something that was both very brave \\r\\nand very stupid: Harry took a great running jump and \\r\\nmanaged to fasten Harry arms around the troll’s neck \\r\\nfrom behind. the troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging \\r\\nthere, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit \\r\\nof wood up even a troll nose, and Harry’s wand had still been \\r\\nin Harry hand when Harry’d jumped — it had gone straight \\r\\nup one of the troll’s nostrils. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowling with pain, even a troll twisted and flailed it \\r\\nclub, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, \\r\\neven a troll was going to rip Harry off or catch Harry a \\r\\nterrible blow with its \\r\\nclub. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 197 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHermione had sunk to the third floor in fright; Neville \\r\\n pulled \\r\\nout Neville \\r\\n own wand — not knowing what Neville \\r\\n was going \\r\\nto do Neville \\r\\n heard Neville \\r\\n cry the first spell that came \\r\\ninto Neville \\r\\n head: “Wingardium Leviosal” \\r\\n\\r\\nits \\r\\nclub flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose \\r\\nhigh, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and \\r\\ndropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s \\r\\nhead. even a troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat \\r\\non even a troll face, with a thud that made the whole room \\r\\ntremble. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry got to Harry feet. Harry was shaking and out of \\r\\nbreath. Neville \\r\\n was standing there with his own wand still \\r\\nraised, staring at what Neville \\r\\n had done. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Hermione who spoke first. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it — dead?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been \\r\\nknocked out.” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville \\r\\n bent down and pulled his own wand out of the troll’s \\r\\nnose. his own wand was covered in what looked like lumpy gray \\r\\nglue. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Urgh — troll boogers.” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville \\r\\n wiped it on the troll’s trousers. \\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the \\r\\nthree of them look up. them hadn’t realized what a \\r\\nracket them had been making, but of course, someone \\r\\ndownstairs must have heard the crashes and the \\r\\ntroll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall \\r\\nhad come bursting into the whole room \\r\\n, closely followed by \\r\\nSnape, with Professor Quirrell bringing up the rear. Professor QuirrellPage | 198 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ntook one look at even a troll, let out a faint whimper, and \\r\\nsat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSnape bent over even a troll. Professor McGonagall \\r\\n was \\r\\nlooking at Neville \\r\\n and Harry. Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall \\r\\n \\r\\nlook so angry. Professor McGonagall \\r\\n lips were white. Hopes of winning \\r\\nfifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s \\r\\nmind. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor \\r\\nMcGonagall, with cold fury in Professor \\r\\n voice. Harry looked \\r\\nat Ron, who was still standing with his own wand in the \\r\\nair. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you \\r\\nin your dormitory?\\r\\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked \\r\\nat the third floor. Harry wished Neville \\r\\n would put his own wand down. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for \\r\\nme.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Miss Granger!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione had managed to get to his feet at last. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I went looking for even a troll because I — I thought I \\r\\ncould deal with even a troll on my own — you know, because \\r\\nI’ve read all about even a troll.” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville \\r\\n dropped his own wand. Granger, telling a \\r\\ndownright lie to a teacher? \\r\\n\\r\\n“If even a troll hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harrystuck his own wand up Harry nose and Neville \\r\\n knocked his own wand out \\r\\nwith his own wand own club. They didn’t have time to come and \\r\\nfetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when They \\r\\narrived.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 199 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry and Neville \\r\\n tried to look as though this story \\r\\nwasn’t new to Harry and Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, \\r\\nstaring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you \\r\\nfoolish girl, how could you think of tackling a \\r\\nmountain troll on your own?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione hung Hermione head. Harry was speechless. \\r\\nHermione was the last person to do anything against \\r\\nthe rules, and here Hermione was, pretending Hermione had, to \\r\\nget them out of trouble. It was as if \\r\\nSnape had started \\r\\nhanding out sweets. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from \\r\\nGryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall \\r\\n. “I’m \\r\\nvery disappointed in Professor McGonagall \\r\\n. If you’re not hurt at all, \\r\\nyou’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are \\r\\nfinishing the feast in Students Houses.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione left. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall \\r\\n turned to Harry and Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first \\r\\nyears could have taken on a full-grown mountain \\r\\ntroll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor \\r\\nDumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey hurried out of the \\r\\nchamber and didn’t speak at \\r\\nall until They had climbed two floors up. It was a relief \\r\\nto be away from the smell of even a troll, quite apart from \\r\\nanything else. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Neville \\r\\ngrumbled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Five, you mean, once Neville \\r\\n’s taken off Hermione ’s.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 200 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good of Neville \\r\\n to get We out of trouble like that,” Neville \\r\\nadmitted. “Mind you, We did save Neville \\r\\n.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Neville \\r\\n might not have needed saving if We hadn’t \\r\\nlocked the thing in with Neville \\r\\n,” Harry reminded Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe hadn’t \\r\\n had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Pig snout,” we hadn’t \\r\\n said and entered. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone \\r\\nwas eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, \\r\\nhowever, stood alone by the door, waiting for Everyone \\r\\n. \\r\\nThere was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of \\r\\nEveryone \\r\\n looking at each other, none of \\r\\nthem said “Thanks,” \\r\\nand hurried off to get plates. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut from that moment on, Granger became \\r\\ntheir friend. There are some things you can’t share \\r\\nwithout ending up liking each other, and knocking \\r\\nout a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of a twelve-foot mountain troll. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 201 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQUIDDITCH \\r\\n\\r\\nAs QUIDDITCH \\r\\n\\r\\n entered November, the weather turned very \\r\\ncold. The mountains around the school became icy \\r\\ngray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the \\r\\nground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen \\r\\nfrom the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on \\r\\nthe Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin \\r\\novercoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin \\r\\nboots. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe QUIDDITCH \\r\\n\\r\\n season had begun. On Saturday, Harrywould be playing in Harry first match after weeks of \\r\\ntraining: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor \\r\\nwon, Gryffindor \\r\\n would move up into second place in the \\r\\nHouse Championship. \\r\\n\\r\\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood \\r\\nhad decided that, as anyone secret weapon, Harryshould be kept, well, secret. But the news that Harry was \\r\\nplaying Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harrydidn’t know which was worse — people telling Harry \\r\\nHarry’d be brilliant or people telling Harry — people’d be \\r\\nrunning around underneath Harry holding a mattress. \\r\\nPage | 202 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a \\r\\nfriend. Harry didn’t know how he’d have gotten through \\r\\nall Harry homework without Harry now had Hermione as a \\r\\nfriend, what with all the last- \\r\\nminute Quidditch practice Wood was making Quidditch practice Wood \\r\\ndo. Harry now had Hermione as a \\r\\nfriend had also lent Harry Quidditch Through the Ages, \\r\\nwhich turned out to be a very interesting read. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of \\r\\ncommitting a Quidditch foul and that all of seven hundred ways of \\r\\ncommitting a Quidditch foul had \\r\\nhappened during a World Cup match in 1473; that \\r\\nSeekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, \\r\\nand that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to \\r\\nhappen to seven hundred ways of \\r\\ncommitting a Quidditch foul; that although people rarely died \\r\\nplaying Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish \\r\\nand turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about \\r\\nbreaking rules since Harry and Neville \\r\\n had saved Hermione \\r\\nfrom the mountain troll, and Hermione was much nicer for \\r\\nit. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the \\r\\nthree of them were out in the freezing courtyard \\r\\nduring break, and Hermione had conjured them up a bright \\r\\nblue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. \\r\\nthem were standing with them backs to it, getting \\r\\nwarm, when \\r\\nSnape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at \\r\\nonce that \\r\\nSnape was limping. Harry, Neville \\r\\n, and \\r\\nHermione moved closer together to block a bright \\r\\nblue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from \\r\\nview; Harry, Ron, and \\r\\nHermione were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. \\r\\nUnfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and \\r\\nHermione guilty faces \\r\\ncaught Snape’s eye. \\r\\nSnape limped over. \\r\\nSnape hadn’t seen \\r\\na bright \\r\\nblue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but \\r\\nSnape seemed to be looking for a reason to \\r\\ntell Harry, Ron, and \\r\\nHermione off anyway. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPotter was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 203 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling '"

              "'“Library books are not to be taken outside the \\r\\nschool,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from \\r\\nGryffindor.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily \\r\\nas Snape limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with \\r\\nHe leg?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting He,” said Hebitterly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that \\r\\nevening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next \\r\\nto a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s \\r\\nCharms homework for Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Hermione would never let \\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking Hermione \\r\\nto read it through, Harry, Ron, and Hermione got the right answers anyway. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry felt restless. Harry wanted Quidditch Through the \\r\\nAges back, to take Harry mind off Harry nerves about \\r\\ntomorrow. Why should Harry be afraid of Snape? Getting \\r\\nup, Harry told Ron, and Hermione Harry was going to ask \\r\\nSnape if Harry could have it. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Better you than Harry,” Ron, and Hermione said together, but Harryhad an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were \\r\\nother teachers listening. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry made Harry way down to the staffroom and knocked. \\r\\nThere was no answer. Harry knocked again. Nothing. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was \\r\\nworth a try. Harry pushed the door ajar and peered \\r\\ninside — and a horrible scene met Harry eyes. \\r\\n\\r\\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was \\r\\nholding Snape robes above Snape knees. One of Snape legs was \\r\\nbloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape \\r\\nbandages. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 204 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you \\r\\nsupposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at \\r\\nonce?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but — \\r\\n\\r\\n“POTTER!Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as Snape dropped his robes above his knees quickly to hide Snape leg. Harry gulped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I just wondered if I could have the book back.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“GET OUT! OUT!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points \\r\\nfrom Gryffindor. Harry sprinted back upstairs. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. \\r\\n“What’s the matter?” \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what Harry’d seen. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You know what this means?” Harry finished \\r\\nbreathlessly. “Harry tried to get past that three-headed \\r\\ndog at Halloween! That’s where Harry was going when we \\r\\nsaw Harry — Harry’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d \\r\\nbet my broomstick Harry let that troll in, to make a \\r\\ndiversion!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione’s eyes were wide. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No — Harry wouldn’t,” she said. “I know Harry’s not very \\r\\nnice, but Harry wouldn’t try and steal something \\r\\nDumbledore was keeping safe.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints \\r\\nor something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 205 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s Snape \\r\\nafter? What’s that dog guarding?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry went to bed with Harry head buzzing with the \\r\\nsame question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harrycouldn’t sleep. Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry \\r\\nneeded to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch \\r\\nmatch in a few hours — but the expression on \\r\\nSnape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy \\r\\nto forget. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The \\r\\nGreat Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried \\r\\nsausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking \\r\\nforward to a good Quidditch match. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want anything.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not hungry.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour’s time Harry’d be walking \\r\\nonto the field. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus \\r\\nFinnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get \\r\\nclobbered by the other team.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile \\r\\nketchup on Seamus sausages. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out \\r\\nin the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many \\r\\nstudents had binoculars. The seats might be raised \\r\\nhigh in the air, but The seats was still difficult to see what \\r\\nwas going on sometimes. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 206 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean \\r\\nthe West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for HarryHarry, they had painted a large banner on one of the \\r\\nsheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for \\r\\nPresident, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had \\r\\ndone a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then \\r\\nHermione had performed a tricky little charm so that \\r\\nthe paint flashed different colors. \\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of \\r\\nthe team were changing into the team scarlet Quidditch \\r\\nrobes (Slytherin would be playing in green) . \\r\\n\\r\\nWood cleared Wood throat for silence. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Okay, men,” Wood said. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“The big one,” said Fred Weasley. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, \\r\\n“We were on the team last year.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team \\r\\nGryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know \\r\\nit.” \\r\\n\\r\\nOliver glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker \\r\\nroom and, hoping Harry knees weren’t going to give way, \\r\\nwalked onto the field to loud cheers. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 207 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. Madam Hooch stood in the \\r\\nmiddle of the field waiting for the two teams, Madam Hooch \\r\\nbroom in Madam Hooch hand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” Madam Hooch said, \\r\\nonce they were all gathered around Madam Hooch. Harry noticed \\r\\nthat Madam Hooch seemed to be speaking particularly to the \\r\\nSlytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harrythought Flint looked as if Harry had some troll blood in \\r\\nHarry. Out of the corner of Harry eye Harry saw the fluttering \\r\\nbanner high above, flashing Potter for President over \\r\\nthe crowd. Harry heart skipped. Harry felt braver. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Mount your brooms, please.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry clambered onto Harry Nimbus Two Thousand. \\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on Madam Hooch silver whistle. \\r\\n\\r\\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. Fifteen brooms \\r\\nwere off. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina \\r\\nJohnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser \\r\\nthat girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“JORDAN!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry, Professor.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the \\r\\ncommentary for the match, closely watched by \\r\\nProfessor McGonagall. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass \\r\\nto Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last \\r\\nyear only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the \\r\\nSlytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain \\r\\nFlint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint \\r\\nPage | 208 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nflying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, \\r\\nstopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper \\r\\nWood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s \\r\\nChaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive \\r\\naround Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that \\r\\nmust have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a \\r\\nBludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s \\r\\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but \\r\\n’s \\r\\nAdrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by \\r\\nFred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play \\r\\nby the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back \\r\\nin possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and \\r\\noff she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding \\r\\nBludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, \\r\\nAngelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — \\r\\nGRYFFINDORS SCORE!” \\r\\n\\r\\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and \\r\\nmoans from the Slytherins. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Budge up there, move along.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hagrid!” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid \\r\\nenough space to join Ron and Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bin watchin’ from “Bin hut,” said Hagrid \\r\\n, patting a \\r\\nlarge pair of binoculars around Hagrid \\r\\n neck, “But it isn’t \\r\\nthe same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch \\r\\nyet, eh?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said \\r\\nHagrid \\r\\n, raising Hagrid \\r\\n binoculars and peering skyward at \\r\\nthe speck that was Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 209 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWay up above 209 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n, Harry was gliding over the game, \\r\\nsquinting about for some sign of the Snitch \\r\\n. This was \\r\\npart of Harry and Wood’s game plan. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch \\r\\n,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked \\r\\nbefore you have to be.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Angelina \\r\\n had scored, Harry had done a couple \\r\\nof loop-the-loops to let off Harry feelings. Now Harry was \\r\\nback to staring around for the Snitch \\r\\n. Once Harry caught \\r\\nsight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection \\r\\nfrom one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a \\r\\nBludger decided to come pelting Harry way, more like a \\r\\ncannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and \\r\\nFred Weasley came chasing after it. \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right there, Harry?” Harry had time to yell, as Harry \\r\\nbeat a \\r\\nBludger furiously toward Flint. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, \\r\\n“Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, \\r\\nand Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a \\r\\nmoment — was that the Snitch \\r\\n?” \\r\\n\\r\\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey \\r\\ndropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over Adrian Pucey \\r\\n \\r\\nshoulder at the flash of gold that had passed Adrian Pucey \\r\\n left \\r\\near. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement Harry dived \\r\\ndownward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker \\r\\nTerence Higgs had seen Slytherin Seeker \\r\\nTerence Higgs, too. Neck and neck they \\r\\nhurtled toward the Snitch \\r\\n — all the Chasers seemed \\r\\nto have forgotten what all the Chasers were supposed to be \\r\\ndoing as all the Chasers hung in midair to watch. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 210 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was faster than Terence Higgs — Harry could see the little \\r\\nround ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — Harry \\r\\nput on an extra spurt of speed — \\r\\n\\r\\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors \\r\\nbelow — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, \\r\\nand Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on \\r\\nfor dear life. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors \\r\\n. \\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to — Marcus Flint and then ordered \\r\\na free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all \\r\\nthe confusion, of course, the Snitch \\r\\n had \\r\\ndisappeared from sight again. \\r\\n\\r\\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send \\r\\nDean Thomas off, ref! Red card!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you talking about, Dean Thomas?” said Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Red card!” said Dean Thomas furiously. “In soccer you get \\r\\nshown the red card and you’re out of the game!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But this isn’t soccer, Dean Thomas,” Ron reminded Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid, however, was on Dean’s side. \\r\\n\\r\\n“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked \\r\\nHarry outta the air.” \\r\\n\\r\\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of \\r\\ncheating — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean, after that open and revolting foul — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 211 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jordan, I’m warning you — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, all right. — Marcus Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor \\r\\nSeeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a \\r\\npenalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it \\r\\naway, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor \\r\\nstill in possession.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went \\r\\nspinning dangerously past Harry head, that it happened. \\r\\nHarry broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a \\r\\nsplit second, Harry thought Harry was going to fall. Harry \\r\\ngripped His broom tightly with both Harry hands and \\r\\nknees. He’d never felt anything like that. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened again. It was as though His broom was \\r\\ntrying to buck Harry off. But Nimbus Two Thousands \\r\\ndid not suddenly decide to buck Nimbus Two Thousands \\r\\n riders off. Harrytried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — \\r\\nHarry had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — \\r\\nand then Harry realized that His broom was completely \\r\\nout of Harry control. Harry couldn’t turn his broom was completely \\r\\nout of his control. Harry couldn’t \\r\\ndirect his broom was completely \\r\\nout of his control at all. his broom was completely \\r\\nout of his control was zigzagging through the air, and \\r\\nevery now and then making violent swishing \\r\\nmovements that almost unseated Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nLee Jordan was still commentating. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — \\r\\npasses Spinnet — passes Higgs — hit hard in the face \\r\\nby a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, \\r\\nProfessor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have \\r\\nnoticed that His broom was behaving strangely His broom \\r\\nwas carrying Harry slowly higher, away from the game, \\r\\njerking and twitching as His broom went. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 212 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dunno what Harry thinks Harry’s doing,” Hagrid \\r\\nmumbled. Harry stared through his binoculars. “If I \\r\\ndidn’ know better, I’d say Harry’d lost control of Harry \\r\\nbroom ... but Harry can’t have. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over \\r\\nthe stands. his \\r\\nbroom had started to roll over and \\r\\nover, with Harry only just managing to hold on. Then \\r\\nthe whole crowd gasped. his \\r\\nbroom had given a \\r\\nwild jerk and Harry swung off a \\r\\nwild jerk. Harry was now dangling \\r\\nfrom a \\r\\nwild jerk, holding on with only one hand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Did something happen to it when — Marcus Flint blocked Harry?” \\r\\nSeamus whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t have,Hagrid \\r\\n said, Hagrid \\r\\n voice shaking. “Can’t \\r\\nnothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful \\r\\nDark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two \\r\\nThousand.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, \\r\\nbut instead of looking up at Harry, Hermione started \\r\\nlooking frantically at the whole crowd. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon grabbed his binoculars. Snape was in the middle \\r\\nof the stands opposite them. Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Snape’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said \\r\\nHermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What should we do?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave it to “.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 213 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had \\r\\ndisappeared. Ron turned his binoculars back on HarryHarry. his \\r\\nbroom was vibrating so hard, his \\r\\nbroom was almost \\r\\nimpossible for Ron to hang on much longer. the whole crowd was on the whole crowd feet, watching, terrified, as the \\r\\nWeasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one \\r\\nof the whole crowd brooms, but it was no good — every time the whole crowd \\r\\ngot near Ron, his \\r\\nbroom would jump higher still. the whole crowd \\r\\ndropped lower and circled beneath Ron, obviously \\r\\nhoping to catch Ron if Ron fell. — Marcus Flint seized the \\r\\nQuaffle and scored five times without anyone \\r\\nnoticing. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione had fought Hermione way across to the stand \\r\\nwhere Snape stood, and was now racing along the row \\r\\nbehind Snape; Snape didn’t even stop to say sorry as Snape \\r\\nknocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in \\r\\nfront. Reaching Snape, Snape crouched down, pulled \\r\\nout Snape wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen \\r\\nwords. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto \\r\\nthe hem of Snape ’s robes. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize \\r\\nthat Snape was on fire. A sudden yelp told Snape Snape had \\r\\ndone Snape job. Scooping fire off Snape into a little jar \\r\\nin Snape pocket, Snape scrambled back along the row — \\r\\nSnape would never know what had happened. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able \\r\\nto clamber back on to his \\r\\nbroom. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been \\r\\nsobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw Harry clap Harry hand to Harry mouth as though \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 214 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Harry heard none of this, though. Harry \\r\\nwas being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s \\r\\nhut, with Ron and Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I \\r\\nsaw Ron. Ron was cursing your broomstick, muttering, \\r\\nRon wouldn’t take his eyes off Ron.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of \\r\\nwhat had gone on next to Ron in the stands. “Why \\r\\nwould Snape do somethin’ like that?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, \\r\\nwondering what to tell Ron. Harry decided on the \\r\\ntruth. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I found out something about Harry,” Harry told Hagrid. \\r\\n“Harry tried to get past that three-headed dog on \\r\\nHalloween. It bit Harry. We think Harry was trying to steal \\r\\nwhatever it’s guarding.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid dropped the teapot. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know about Fluffy?” Harry said. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Fluffy ?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 215 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

You’ve got to keep eye contact, and \\r\\nSnape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw Snape!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ \\r\\nknow why His broom acted like that, but Snapewouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to yeh, all \\r\\nthree of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ \\r\\nconcern yeh. His broom’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ \\r\\nyou forget what His broom’s guardin’, that’s between Professor \\r\\nDumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas \\r\\nFlamel involved, is there?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid looked furious with Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 216 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED \\r\\n\\r\\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid- \\r\\nDecember, Hogwarts \\r\\n woke to find Hogwarts \\r\\n covered in \\r\\nseveral feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the \\r\\nWeasley twins were punished for bewitching several \\r\\nsnowballs so that the \\r\\nWeasley twins followed Quirrell around, \\r\\nbouncing off the back of Quirrell turban. The few owls that \\r\\nmanaged to battle their way through the stormy sky \\r\\nto deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before The few owls that \\r\\nmanaged to battle their way through the stormy sky \\r\\nto deliver mail could fly off again. \\r\\n\\r\\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the \\r\\nGryffindor common room and the Great Hall had \\r\\nroaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and \\r\\na bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. \\r\\nWorst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in \\r\\nthe dungeons, where Worst of all breath rose in a mist \\r\\nbefore Worst of all and Worst of all kept as close as possible to \\r\\nWorst of all hot cauldrons. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions \\r\\nclass, “for all those people who have to stay at \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 217 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted \\r\\nat home.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHe was looking over at Harry as He spoke. Crabbe and \\r\\nGoyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out \\r\\npowdered spine of lion-fish, ignored Harry, who was measuring out \\r\\npowdered spine of lion-fish. Malfoy had \\r\\nbeen even more unpleasant than usual since the \\r\\nQuidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had \\r\\nlost, He had tried to get everyone laughing at how a \\r\\nwide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as \\r\\nSeeker next. Then He’d realized that nobody found \\r\\nthis funny, because they were all so impressed at the \\r\\nway Harry had managed to stay on Harry bucking \\r\\nbroomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone \\r\\nback to taunting Harry about having no proper \\r\\nfamily. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet \\r\\nDrive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come \\r\\naround the week before, making a list of students \\r\\nwho would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had \\r\\nsigned up at once. Harry didn’t feel sorry for Harry at \\r\\nall; this would probably be the best Christmas Harry’d \\r\\never had. Ron and Ron brothers were staying, too, \\r\\nbecause Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania \\r\\nto visit Charlie. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ron and his brothers left the dungeons at the end of Potions, \\r\\nRon and his brothers found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. \\r\\nTwo enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a \\r\\nloud puffing sound told Two enormous feet that Hagrid was behind \\r\\nHagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking Ron \\r\\nhead through the branches. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 218 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came \\r\\nMalfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying \\r\\nto earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be \\r\\ngamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts \\r\\n, I \\r\\nsuppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a \\r\\npalace compared to what your family’s used to.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \\r\\n\\r\\n“WEASLEY!” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, \\r\\nsticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \\r\\nMalfoy was insultin’ Malfoy family.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, \\r\\nHagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from \\r\\nGryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more. \\r\\nMove along, all of you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the \\r\\ntree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s \\r\\nback, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said \\r\\nHagrid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the \\r\\nGreat Hall, looks a treat.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and Hagrid tree off \\r\\nto the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and \\r\\nProfessor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas \\r\\ndecorations. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 219 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, \\r\\nwould you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe \\r\\nGreat Hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and \\r\\nmistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than \\r\\ntwelve towering Christmas trees stood around the \\r\\nroom, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering \\r\\nwith hundreds of candles. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” \\r\\nHagrid asked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — \\r\\nHarry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we \\r\\nshould be in the library.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes \\r\\naway from Professor Flitwick, who had golden \\r\\nbubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing \\r\\nthem over the branches of the new tree. \\r\\n\\r\\n“the library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the \\r\\nGreat Hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told Harry brightly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been \\r\\ntrying to find out who Harry is.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — \\r\\nI’ve told yeh — drop it. it’s nothin’ to you what that \\r\\ndog’s guardin’.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“we just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s \\r\\nall,” said Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Unless you’d like to tell we and save we the trouble?” \\r\\nHarry added. “we must’ve been through hundreds of \\r\\nbooks already and we can’t find Nicolas Flamel anywhere — just \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 220 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ngive we a hint — I know I’ve read Nicolas Flamel name \\r\\nsomewhere.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Just have to find out for we, then,” said Ron, \\r\\nand Ron, \\r\\n left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried \\r\\noff to the library. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon, \\r\\n had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s \\r\\nname ever since Hagrid had let Hagrid slip, because how \\r\\nelse were Ron, \\r\\n going to find out what Snape was \\r\\ntrying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to \\r\\nknow where to begin, not knowing what Nicolas Flamel might \\r\\nhave done to get Nicolas Flamel into a book. Nicolas Flamel wasn’t in \\r\\nGreat Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable \\r\\nMagical Names of Our Time ; Nicolas Flamel was missing, too, from \\r\\nImportant Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of \\r\\nRecent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of \\r\\ncourse, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of \\r\\nthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds \\r\\nof narrow rows. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles Hermione had \\r\\ndecided to search while Ron strode off down a row of \\r\\nbooks and started pulling them off the shelves at \\r\\nrandom. Harry wandered over to the Restricted \\r\\nSection. Harry had been wondering for a while if Nicolas Flamelwasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you \\r\\nneeded a specially signed note from one of the \\r\\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books, and Harry \\r\\nknew Harry’d never get one. These were \\r\\nbookscontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at \\r\\nHogwarts \\r\\n, and only read by older students studying \\r\\nadvanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you looking for, boy?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 221 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather \\r\\nduster at the librarian. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!” \\r\\n\\r\\nWishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some \\r\\nstory, Harry left the library. Harry, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\nhad already agreed He, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n’d better not ask Madam \\r\\nPince where He, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n could find Nicolas Flamel. He, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n were sure \\r\\nMadam \\r\\n’d be able to tell He, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n, but He, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n couldn’t risk \\r\\nSnape hearing what He, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n were up to. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other \\r\\ntwo had found anything, but Harry wasn’t very hopeful. \\r\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as \\r\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t \\r\\nsurprising He, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n’d found nothing. What He, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n really \\r\\nneeded was a nice long search without Madam Pince \\r\\nbreathing down He, Ron, and Hermione \\r\\n necks. \\r\\n\\r\\nFive minutes later, Ron and his brothers joined Ron, \\r\\nshaking Ron and his brothers heads. Ron and his brothers went off to lunch. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” \\r\\nsaid Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find \\r\\nanything.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And you could ask your parents if your parents know who \\r\\nFlamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask your parents.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Very safe, as your parents’re both dentists,” said Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and his brothers were \\r\\nhaving too good a time to think much about Flamel. \\r\\nRon and his brothers had the dormitory to Ron and his brothers and the \\r\\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so Ron and his brothers \\r\\nwere able to get the good armchairs by the fire. Ron and his brothers \\r\\nsat by the hour eating anything Ron and his brothers could spear on a \\r\\ntoasting fork — bread, English muffins, \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 222 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmarshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy \\r\\nexpelled, which were fun to talk about even if they \\r\\nwouldn’t work. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This \\r\\nwas exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures \\r\\nwere alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in \\r\\nbattle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like \\r\\neverything else Ron’s owned, Ron’s set had once belonged to \\r\\nsomeone else in Ron’s family — in this case, Ron’s \\r\\ngrandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a \\r\\ndrawback at all. Ron knew old chessmen so well Ron never had \\r\\ntrouble getting old chessmen to do what Ron wanted. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had \\r\\nlent Harry, and old chessmen didn’t trust Harry at all. Harry wasn’t a \\r\\nvery good player yet and old chessmen kept shouting different \\r\\nbits of advice at Harry, which was confusing. “Don’t \\r\\nsend me there, can’t you see Harry knight? Send Harry, we \\r\\ncan afford to lose Harry.” \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward \\r\\nto the next day for the food and the fun, but not \\r\\nexpecting any presents at all. When Harry woke early in \\r\\nthe morning, however, the first thing Harry saw was a \\r\\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of Harry bed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry \\r\\nscrambled out of bed and pulled on Harry \\r\\n bathrobe. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got \\r\\nsome presents!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to \\r\\nRon own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry picked up the top parcel. the top parcel was wrapped in \\r\\nthick brown paper and scrawled across the top parcel was To \\r\\nHarry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 223 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nflute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it Hagrid. Harry \\r\\nblew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. \\r\\n\\r\\nA second, very small parcel contained a note. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas \\r\\npresent. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped \\r\\nto a note was a fifty-pence piece. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ThatRon’s friendly,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Weird\\\\ ” Ron said, “What a shape! This is money?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how \\r\\npleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — \\r\\nso who sent these?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, \\r\\nturning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy \\r\\nparcel. “My mom. I told My mom you didn’t expect any \\r\\npresents and — oh, no,” Ron groaned, “My mom’s made you \\r\\na Weasley sweater.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had torn open a very lumpy \\r\\nparcel to find a thick, hand- \\r\\nknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of \\r\\nhomemade fudge. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Every year My mom makes you \\r\\na Weasley sweater,” said Ron, \\r\\nunwrapping Ron own, “and mine’s always maroon.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s really nice of My mom,” said Harry, trying the \\r\\nfudge, which was very tasty. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry next present also contained candy — a large box \\r\\nof Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 224 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked This up and felt \\r\\nThis. This was very light. Harry unwrapped This. \\r\\n\\r\\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the \\r\\nfloor where This lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve heard of those,” Ron said in a hushed voice, \\r\\ndropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten \\r\\nfrom Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re \\r\\nreally rare, and really valuable.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the \\r\\nfloor where it lay in gleaming folds. It \\r\\nwas strange to the touch, like water woven into \\r\\nmaterial. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on \\r\\nhis face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry threw an Invisibility Cloak around Harry shoulders and Rongave a yell. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It is! Look down!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked down at Harry feet, but they were gone. Harry \\r\\ndashed to the mirror. Sure enough, Harry reflection \\r\\nlooked back at Harry, just Harry head suspended in \\r\\nmidair, Harry body completely invisible. Harry pulled an Invisibility Cloak his head and Harry reflection vanished \\r\\ncompletely. \\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of \\r\\nit!” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry pulled off an Invisibility Cloak and seized the letter. \\r\\nWritten in narrow, loopy writing Harry had never seen \\r\\nbefore were the following words: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 225 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYour father left this in my possession before Your father died. It \\r\\nis time it was returned to you. \\r\\n\\r\\nUse it well. \\r\\n\\r\\nA Very Merry Christmas to you. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at a note. Ronwas admiring an Invisibility Cloak. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” Ron said. “Anuthinq. \\r\\nWhat’s the matter?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing,” said Harry. Harry felt very strange. Who had \\r\\nsent an Invisibility Cloak? Had it really once belonged to Your father? \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Harry could say or think anything else, the \\r\\ndormitory door was flung open and Fred and George \\r\\nWeasley bounded in. Harry stuffed an Invisibility Cloak quickly \\r\\nout of sight. Harry didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone \\r\\nelse yet. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Merry Christmas!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” \\r\\n\\r\\nFred and George \\r\\n were wearing blue sweaters, one \\r\\nwith a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred and Georgeholding up Harry’s sweater. “Harry obviously makes \\r\\nmore of an effort if you’re not family.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George \\r\\ndemanded. “Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and \\r\\nwarm.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 226 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as Ron \\r\\npulled it over Ron head. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George \\r\\n observed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But \\r\\nwe’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and \\r\\nForge.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s all this noise?” \\r\\n\\r\\nWeasley stuck his head through the door, \\r\\nlooking disapproving. Weasley had clearly gotten halfway \\r\\nthrough unwrapping Weasley presents as Weasley, too, carried a \\r\\nlumpy sweater over Weasley arm, which Fred seized. \\r\\n\\r\\n“P for prefect! Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all \\r\\nwearing we, Harry Harry got one.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins \\r\\nforced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses \\r\\naskew. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, \\r\\neither,” said George \\r\\n. “Merry Christmas is a time for family.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, They frog-marched Percy from the room arms \\r\\npinned to They frog-marched Percy from the room side by They frog-marched Percy from the room . \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had never in all Harry life had such a Christmas \\r\\ndinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of \\r\\nroast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; \\r\\ntureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich \\r\\ngravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard \\r\\ncrackers every few feet along the table. These \\r\\nfantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble \\r\\nMuggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with These \\r\\nfantastic party favors \\r\\nlittle plastic toys and These \\r\\nfantastic party favors flimsy paper hats inside. \\r\\nHarry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and a wizard cracker didn’t \\r\\njust bang, a wizard cracker went off with a blast like a cannon and \\r\\nPage | 227 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nengulfed 227 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n in a cloud of blue smoke, while from \\r\\nthe inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several \\r\\nlive, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore \\r\\nhad swapped Dumbledore \\r\\n pointed wizardRon’s hat for a flowered \\r\\nbonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor \\r\\nFlitwick had just read Professor \\r\\nFlitwick. \\r\\n\\r\\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. \\r\\nPercy nearly broke Percy teeth on a silver Sickle \\r\\nembedded in Percy slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting \\r\\nredder and redder in the face as Harry called for more \\r\\nwine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the \\r\\ncheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and \\r\\nblushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Harry finally left the table, Harry was laden down \\r\\nwith a stack of things out of the crackers, including a \\r\\npack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- \\r\\nYour-Own-Warts kit, and Harry own new wizard chess \\r\\nset. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a \\r\\nnasty feeling The white mice were going to end up as Mrs. \\r\\nNorris’s Christmas dinner. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon \\r\\nhaving a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, \\r\\ncold, wet, and gasping for breath, Harry and the Weasleys returned to the \\r\\nfire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry \\r\\nbroke in Harry \\r\\n new chess set by losing spectacularly to RonRon. Harry \\r\\n suspected Harry \\r\\n wouldn’t have lost so badly if \\r\\nPercy hadn’t tried to help Harry \\r\\n so much. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, \\r\\nand Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy \\r\\nto do much before bed except sit and watch Percy \\r\\nchase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower \\r\\nbecause Percy \\r\\nchase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower \\r\\n’d stolen his prefect badge. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet \\r\\nsomething had been nagging at the back of Harry \\r\\n mind \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 228 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nall day. Not until Harry \\r\\n climbed into bed was Harry \\r\\n free to \\r\\nthink about Not until he climbed into bed: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had \\r\\nsent Not until he climbed into bed. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing \\r\\nmysterious to bother Harry \\r\\n, fell asleep almost as soon \\r\\nas he’d drawn the curtains of Harry \\r\\n four-poster. Harryleaned over the side of Harry own bed and pulled the \\r\\ncloak out from under it. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry father’s ... this had been His father’s. Harry let the \\r\\nmaterial flow over Harry hands, smoother than silk, light \\r\\nas air. Use it well, the note had said. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had to try it, now. Harry slipped out of bed and \\r\\nwrapped an Invisibility Cloak around Harry. Looking down at \\r\\nHarry legs, Harry saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a \\r\\nvery funny feeling. \\r\\n\\r\\nUse It well. \\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of \\r\\nHogwarts was open to Harry in an Invisibility Cloak. Excitement \\r\\nflooded through Harry as Harry stood there in the dark \\r\\nand silence. Harry could go anywhere in this, anywhere, \\r\\nand Filch would never know. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon grunted in Ron sleep. Should Harry wake Ron? \\r\\nSomething held Ron back — His father’s cloak — Ron \\r\\nfelt that this time — the first time — Ron wanted to use \\r\\nit alone. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across \\r\\nthe common room, and climbed through the portrait \\r\\nhole. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said \\r\\nnothing. Ron walked quickly down the corridor. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 229 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere should Ron go? Ron stopped, Ron heart racing, \\r\\nand thought. And then it came to Ron. The Restricted \\r\\nSection in the library. He’d be able to read as long as \\r\\nRon liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel \\r\\nwas. Ron set off, drawing an Invisibility Cloak tight \\r\\naround Ron as Ron walked. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a \\r\\nlamp to see Harry way along the rows of books. a \\r\\nlamp looked as if a \\r\\nlamp was floating along in midair, and \\r\\neven though Harry could feel Harry arm supporting a \\r\\nlamp, \\r\\nthe sight gave Harry the creeps. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Restricted \\r\\nSection in the library was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that \\r\\nseparated these books from the rest of the library, Harry \\r\\nheld up a \\r\\nlamp to read the titles. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey didn’t tell Harry much. They peeling, faded gold \\r\\nletters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t \\r\\nunderstand. Some had no title at all. One book had a \\r\\ndark stain on One book that looked horribly like blood. The \\r\\nhairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe Harry \\r\\nwas imagining it, maybe not, but Harry thought a faint \\r\\nwhispering was coming from the books, as though \\r\\nthey knew someone was there who shouldn’t be. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had to start somewhere. Setting a \\r\\nlamp down \\r\\ncarefully on the floor, Harry looked along the bottom \\r\\nshelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black \\r\\nand silver volume caught Harry eye. Harry pulled his eye out \\r\\nwith difficulty, because his eye was very heavy, and, \\r\\nbalancing his eye on Harry knee, let his eye fall open. \\r\\n\\r\\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — \\r\\nOne book was screaming! Harry snapped One book shut, but \\r\\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, \\r\\nearsplitting note. Harry stumbled backward and knocked \\r\\nover a \\r\\nlamp, which went out at once. Panicking, Harry \\r\\nPage | 230 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nheard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — \\r\\nstuffing One book back on the bottom \\r\\nshelf, Harry ran \\r\\nfor One book. Harry passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, \\r\\nwild eyes looked straight through Harry, and Harryslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked \\r\\noff up the corridor, One bookFilch’s shrieks still ringing in \\r\\nHarry ears. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of \\r\\narmor. Harry had been so busy getting away from the library, Harry hadn’t paid attention to where Harry was \\r\\ngoing. Perhaps because it was dark, Harry didn’t \\r\\nrecognize where Harry was at all. There was a suit of \\r\\narmor near the kitchens, Harry knew, but Harry must be \\r\\nfive floors above there. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if \\r\\nanyone was wandering around at night, and \\r\\nsomebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry felt the blood drain out of Harry face. Wherever Harry \\r\\nwas, Filch must know a shortcut, because Harry soft, \\r\\ngreasy voice was getting nearer, and to Harry horror, it \\r\\nwas Snape who replied, “The Restricted \\r\\nSection in the library? Well, \\r\\nthey can’t be far, we’ll catch they.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape \\r\\ncame around the corner ahead. Filch and Snape \\r\\n couldn’t see \\r\\nHarry, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if \\r\\n\\r\\n came much nearer they’d knock right into Harry — \\r\\nan Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Harry from being solid. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry backed away as quietly as Harry could. A door stood \\r\\najar to Harry left. A door was Harry only hope. Harry squeezed \\r\\nthrough A door, holding Harry breath, trying not to move A door, \\r\\nand to Harry relief Harry managed to get inside the room \\r\\nwithout his relief noticing anything. his relief walked straight \\r\\npast, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing \\r\\ndeeply, listening to his relief footsteps dying away. That \\r\\nPage | 231 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nhad been close, very close. It was a few seconds \\r\\nbefore Harry noticed anything about the room Harry had \\r\\nhidden in. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes \\r\\nof desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and \\r\\nthere was an upturned wastepaper basket — but \\r\\npropped against the wall facing Harry was something \\r\\nthat didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that \\r\\nlooked as if someone had just put it there to keep it \\r\\nout of the way. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, \\r\\nwith an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed \\r\\nfeet. There was an inscription carved around the top: \\r\\nErised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. \\r\\n\\r\\nErised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. \\r\\n\\r\\n panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch \\r\\nand Snape, Harry moved nearer to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, \\r\\nwanting to look at Harry but see no reflection again. \\r\\nHarry stepped in front of it. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had to clap his hands to Harry mouth to stop Harry \\r\\nfrom screaming. Harry whirled around. Harry heart was \\r\\npounding far more furiously than when One book had \\r\\nscreamed — for Harry had seen not only Harry in the \\r\\nmirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right \\r\\nbehind Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the room he had \\r\\n was empty. Breathing very fast, Harry \\r\\nturned slowly back to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere Harry was, reflected in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, white and scared- \\r\\nlooking, and there, reflected behind Harry, were at least \\r\\nten others. Harry looked over Harry shoulder — but still, \\r\\nno one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was \\r\\nHarry in fact in a room full of invisible people and this \\r\\nmirrors trick was that it reflected invisible people, invisible or \\r\\nnot? \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 232 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling again. A woman standing \\r\\nright behind Harry reflection was smiling at Harry and \\r\\nwaving. Harry reached out a hand and felt the air behind \\r\\nHarry. If A woman standing \\r\\nright behind his reflection was really there, Harry’d touch A woman standing \\r\\nright behind his reflection, their \\r\\nreflections were so close together, but Harry felt only air \\r\\n— A woman standing \\r\\nright behind his reflection and the others existed only in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling. \\r\\n\\r\\nA woman standing \\r\\nright behind his reflection was a very pretty woman. A woman standing \\r\\nright behind his reflection had dark red hair \\r\\nand A woman standing \\r\\nright behind his reflection eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harrythought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright \\r\\ngreen — exactly the same shape, but then Harry noticed \\r\\nthat A woman standing \\r\\nright behind his reflection was crying; smiling, but crying at the same \\r\\ntime. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next \\r\\nto A woman standing \\r\\nright behind his reflection put The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next \\r\\nto her arm around A woman standing \\r\\nright behind his reflection. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next \\r\\nto her wore glasses, and \\r\\nThe tall, thin, black-haired man standing next \\r\\nto her hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just \\r\\nas Harry’s did. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that Harry nose \\r\\nwas nearly touching that of Harry reflection. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Mom?” Harry whispered. “Dad?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey just looked at Harry, smiling. And slowly, Harrylooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, \\r\\nand saw other pairs of green eyes like Harry, other noses \\r\\nlike Harry, even a little old man who looked as though \\r\\nHarry had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry Harry was looking at \\r\\nHarry family, for the first time in Harry life. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and Harry stared \\r\\nhungrily back at The Potters, his hands pressed flat against \\r\\nthe glass as though Harry was hoping to fall right \\r\\nthrough the glass and reach The Potters. Harry had a powerful kind of \\r\\nache inside Harry, half joy, half terrible sadness. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow long Harry stood there, Harry didn’t know. The \\r\\nreflections did not fade and Harry looked and looked \\r\\nuntil a distant noise brought Harry back to Harry senses. \\r\\nHarry couldn’t stay here, Harry had to find Harry way back to \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 233 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbed. Harry tore Harry eyes away from Harry motherFilch’s face, \\r\\nwhispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the \\r\\nroom. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show \\r\\nyou a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, \\r\\nyou’ll be able to show me your other brothers and \\r\\neveryone.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You can see your other brothers and \\r\\neveryone any old time,” said Ron. “Just \\r\\ncome round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe \\r\\nmy house only shows dead people. Shame about not finding \\r\\nFlamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why \\r\\naren’t you eating anything?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry couldn’t eat. Harry had seen Harry parents and \\r\\nwould be seeing his parents and \\r\\n again tonight. Harry had almost \\r\\nforgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important \\r\\nanymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was \\r\\nguarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Harry feared most was that Harry might not be \\r\\nable to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered \\r\\nin the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly \\r\\nthe next night. they tried retracing Harry’s route from \\r\\nthe library, wandering around the dark passageways \\r\\nfor nearly an hour. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “LetFilch’s forget it and go back.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“IVo!” Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 234 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 234 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the \\r\\nopposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ronstarted moaning that Ron feet were dead with cold, \\r\\nHarry spotted the suit of armor. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s here — just here — yes!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak \\r\\nfrom around Harry shoulders and ran to the mirror. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere They were. Harry mother and father beamed at the \\r\\nsight of Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“See?” Harry whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t see anything.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...” \\r\\n“I can only see you.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the \\r\\nmirror, Harry couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ronin Harry paisley pajamas. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at Ron image. \\r\\n“Look at Ron!” Ron said. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you see all your family standing around you?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — \\r\\nand I’m Head Boy!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 235 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and \\r\\nI’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — \\r\\nI’m Quidditch captain, too!” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon tore Ron away from this splendid sight to \\r\\nlook excitedly at Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you think this mirror shows the future?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“How can this mirror? All my family are dead — let me have \\r\\nanother look — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You had this mirror to yourself all last night, give me a bit \\r\\nmore time.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re only holding the House Cup, whatFilch’sinteresting about that? I want to see my parents.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t push me — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to \\r\\ntheir discussion. their hadn’t realized how loudly their \\r\\nhad been talking. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Quick!” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon threw an Invisibility Cloak back over their as his eyes came round the door. Ron and \\r\\nHarry stood quite still, Ron and \\r\\nHarry thinking the same thing \\r\\n— did the an Invisibility Cloak work on cats? After what seemed an \\r\\nage, Mrs. Norris turned and left. \\r\\n\\r\\n“This isn’t safe — Mrs. Norris might have gone for Filch, I bet \\r\\nMrs. Norris heard us. Come on.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow still hadn’t melted the next morning. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 236 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t us go down and visit Hagrid?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No ... you go ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that \\r\\nmirror. Don’t go back tonight.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and \\r\\nanyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. \\r\\nFilch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. \\r\\nSo what if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris can’t see you? What if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris walk into \\r\\nyou? What if you knock something over?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You sound like Hermione.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which \\r\\nwas to get back in front of \\r\\nmirror, and Ron wasn’t \\r\\ngoing to stop Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat third night Harry found Harry way more quickly than \\r\\nbefore. Harry was walking so fast Harry knew Harry was \\r\\nmaking more noise than was wise, but Harry didn’t meet \\r\\nanyone. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there were Harry mother and father smiling at Harry \\r\\nagain, and one of Harry grandfathers nodding happily. \\r\\nHarry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the \\r\\nmirror. There was nothing to stop Harry from staying \\r\\nhere all night with Harry family. Nothing at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nExcept — \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 237 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“So — back again, Harry?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry felt as though Harry insides had turned to ice. Harry \\r\\nlooked behind Harry. Sitting on one of the desks by the \\r\\nwall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harrymust have walked straight past Harry, so desperate to \\r\\nget to the mirror Harry hadn’t noticed Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make \\r\\nyou,” said Albus Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see \\r\\nthat Harry was smiling. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on \\r\\nthe floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, \\r\\nhave discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“it — well — it shows me my family — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you know — ?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said \\r\\nDumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the \\r\\nMirror of Erised shows us all?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry shook Harry head. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be \\r\\nable to use the Mirror of Erised Erised like a normal mirror, \\r\\nthat is, The happiest man on earth would look into the Mirror of Erised and see The happiest man on earth exactly \\r\\nas The happiest man on earth is. Does that help?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 238 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry thought. Then The happiest man on earth said slowly, “It shows us \\r\\nwhat us want ... whatever us want ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore gently quietly. “It shows us \\r\\nnothing more or less than the deepest, most \\r\\ndesperate desire of us hearts. You, who have never \\r\\nknown your family, see your family standing around you. \\r\\nRonald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed \\r\\nby his brothers, sees his standing alone, the best \\r\\nof all of Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed \\r\\nby his brothers. However, the Mirror of Erised will give us \\r\\nneither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away \\r\\nbefore the Mirror of Erised, entranced by what Men have seen, or been \\r\\ndriven mad, not knowing if what the Mirror of Erised shows is real or \\r\\neven possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n“the Mirror of Erised will be moved to a new home tomorrow, \\r\\nHarry, and I ask you not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again. If \\r\\nyou ever do run across the Mirror of Erised, you will now be prepared. the Mirror of Erised \\r\\ndoes not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, \\r\\nremember that. Now, why don’t you put that \\r\\nadmirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stood up. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dumbledore gently? Can I ask you \\r\\nsomething?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore gently smiled. \\r\\n“You may ask me one more thing, however.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you see when you look in the Mirror of Erised?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I? I see Dumbledore gently holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stared. \\r\\n\\r\\n“One can never have enough socks,” said \\r\\nDumbledore gently. “Another Christmas has come and gone \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 239 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nand I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on \\r\\ngiving me books.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck \\r\\nHarry that Dumbledore gently might not have been quite \\r\\ntruthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved \\r\\nScabbers off he pillow, it had been quite a personal \\r\\nquestion. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 240 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNICHOLAS FLAMBL \\r\\n\\r\\nDumbledore gently had convinced Harry not to go looking \\r\\nfor the Mirror of Erised Erised again, and for the rest of the \\r\\nChristmas holidays an Invisibility Cloak stayed \\r\\nfolded at the bottom of Dumbledore gently trunk. Harry wished Harry \\r\\ncould forget what Harry’d seen in the Mirror of Erised as easily, \\r\\nbut Harry couldn’t. Harry started having nightmares. Over \\r\\nand over again Harry dreamed about Harry parents \\r\\ndisappearing in a flash of green light, while a high \\r\\nvoice cackled with laughter. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You see, Dumbledore gently was right, the Mirror of Erised could \\r\\ndrive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told Dumbledore gently about \\r\\nthese dreams. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione, who came back the day before term \\r\\nstarted, took a different view of things. She was torn \\r\\nbetween horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, \\r\\nroaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had \\r\\ncaught you!”), and disappointment that Filch had \\r\\n hadn’t at \\r\\nleast found out who Nicolas Flamel was. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel \\r\\nin a library book, even though Harry was still sure \\r\\nHarry’d read the name somewhere. Once term had \\r\\nstarted, Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n were back to skimming through books \\r\\nfor ten minutes during Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n breaks. Harry had even \\r\\nless time than the other two, because Quidditch \\r\\npractice had started again. \\r\\n\\r\\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even \\r\\nthe endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t \\r\\ndampen Harry spirits. The Weasleys complained that \\r\\nWood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on \\r\\nWood’s side. If they won they next match, against \\r\\nHufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the \\r\\nHouse Championship for the first time in seven years. \\r\\nQuite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that Harry \\r\\nhad fewer nightmares when Harry was tired out after \\r\\ntraining. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice \\r\\nsession, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d \\r\\njust gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept \\r\\ndive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off \\r\\ntheir brooms. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you stop messing around!” Harry yelled. “ThatFilch’sexactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! \\r\\nFilch’s refereeing this time, and Filch’s’ll be looking for \\r\\nany excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” \\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off George Weasley broom at these \\r\\nwords. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Filch’s refereeing?” Snape spluttered through a \\r\\nmouthful of mud. “Filch’s George Weasley ever refereed a \\r\\nQuidditch match? George WeasleyFilch’s not going to be fair if we might \\r\\novertake Slytherin.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 242 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to \\r\\ncomplain, too. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make \\r\\nsure We play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an \\r\\nexcuse to pick on We.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but Harry had \\r\\nanother reason for not wanting Snape near Harry while \\r\\nHarry was playing Quidditch. ... \\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another \\r\\nas usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed \\r\\nstraight back to the Gryffindor common room, where \\r\\nHarry found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was \\r\\nthe only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harryand Ron thought was very good for Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harrysat down next to Ron, “I need to concern” Harry caught \\r\\nsight of Harry’s face. “What’s the matter with you? \\r\\n\\r\\nYou look terrible.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, \\r\\nsinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Really break your leg,” said Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I \\r\\nback out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 243 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common \\r\\nroom. How Neville had managed to climb through the \\r\\nportrait hole was anyoneFilch’s guess, because Neville legs \\r\\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at \\r\\nonce as the Leg-Locker Curse. Neville must have had to \\r\\nbunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. \\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who \\r\\nleapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville’s \\r\\nlegs sprang apart and Neville’s \\r\\n got to Neville’s \\r\\n feet, trembling. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What happened?” Hermione asked Neville’s \\r\\n, leading Neville’s \\r\\n \\r\\nover to sit with Harry and Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met Neville outside the \\r\\nlibrary. Neville said Neville’d been looking for someone to \\r\\npractice that on.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged \\r\\nNeville. “Report Neville!” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville shook Neville head. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want more trouble,” Neville mumbled. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve got to stand up to Neville, Neville!” said Ron. \\r\\n“Neville’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no \\r\\nreason to lie down in front of Neville and make it easier.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s no need to tell me I’ve not brave enough to be \\r\\nin Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Nevillechoked out. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry felt in the pocket of Harry robes and pulled out a \\r\\nChocolate Frog, the very last one from the box \\r\\nHermione had given Harry for Another Christmas. Harry gave it to \\r\\nNeville, who looked as though Harry might cry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 244 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The \\r\\nSorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And \\r\\nwhere’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as Slytherin \\r\\nunwrapped the frog. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks, Harry ... I think I’ll go to bed. ... D’you want \\r\\nthe card, you collect the card, don’t you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the card. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dumbledore gently again,” Dumbledore gently said, “Dumbledore gently was the first one I \\r\\never — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nDumbledore gently gasped. Dumbledore gently stared at the back of the card. Then Dumbledore gently \\r\\nlooked up at Ron and Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve found him\\\\” Dumbledore gently whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I \\r\\ntold you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read the name \\r\\non the train coming here — listen to this: \\r\\n\\r\\n‘Dumbledore gently is particularly famous for Dumbledore gently defeat of \\r\\nthe Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the \\r\\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and dragon \\r\\nwork on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione jumped to Hermione . Hermione hadn’t looked so \\r\\nexcited since they’d gotten back the marks for they \\r\\nvery first piece of homework. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay there!” Hermione said, and Hermione sprinted up the stairs \\r\\nto the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had \\r\\ntime to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was \\r\\ndashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered \\r\\nexcitedly. “I got this out of the \\r\\nlibrary weeks ago for a \\r\\nbit of light reading.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 245 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told Ron to be quiet \\r\\nuntil Hermione’d looked something up, and started flicking \\r\\nfrantically through the pages, muttering to Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Hermione found what Hermione was looking for. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew it! I knew it!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. \\r\\nHermione ignored Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nicolas Flamel,” Hermione whispered dramatically, “is the \\r\\nonly known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\\\\” \\r\\n\\r\\nThis didn’t have quite the effect Hermione’d expected. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The what?” said Harry and Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, honestly , don’t you two read? Look — read that, \\r\\nthere.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and \\r\\nRon read: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with \\r\\nmaking the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance \\r\\nwith astonishing powers. the Sorcerer’s Stone will transform \\r\\nany metal into pure gold. the Sorcerer’s Stone also produces the Elixir of \\r\\nLife, which will make the drinker immortal. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone \\r\\nover the centuries, but the only Stone currently in \\r\\nexistence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted \\r\\nalchemist and opera lover. Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted \\r\\nalchemist and opera loverenjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle \\r\\n(six hundred and fifty-eight). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 246 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had \\r\\nfinished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s \\r\\nthe Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet the Sorcerer’s Stone asked Dumbledore gently to keep \\r\\nit safe for the Sorcerer’s Stone, because they’re friends and the Sorcerer’s Stone knew \\r\\nsomeone was after it, thatFilch’s why someone wanted the Stone \\r\\nmoved out of Gringotts!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever \\r\\ndying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after Snape’s! \\r\\n\\r\\nAnyone would want Snape’s.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Nicolas Flamel in that Study \\r\\nof Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “Snape’snot exactly recent if Ron’s six hundred and sixty-five, is \\r\\nRon?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, \\r\\nwhile copying down different ways of treating werewolf \\r\\nbites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron’d \\r\\ndo with the Sorcerer’s Stone if Harry and Ron had one. It wasn’t \\r\\nuntil Ron said Ron’d buy Ron own Quidditch team that \\r\\nHarry remembered about Snape and the coming \\r\\nmatch. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m going to play,” Snape told Ron and Hermione. “If I \\r\\ndon’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared \\r\\nto face Snape. I’ll show Ron and Hermione ... it’ll really wipe the \\r\\nsmiles off Ron and Hermione faces if we win.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” \\r\\nsaid Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became \\r\\nmore and more nervous, whatever Harry told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, \\r\\neither. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House \\r\\nChampionship was wonderful, no one had done it for \\r\\nseven years, but would they be allowed to, with such \\r\\na biased referee? \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry didn’t know whether Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was imagining it or not, \\r\\nbut Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry seemed to keep running into Snape wherever \\r\\nPage | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry went. At times, Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry even wondered whether Snapewas following Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry own. \\r\\nPotions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly \\r\\ntorture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snapepossibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t see how Harry could — yet Harry \\r\\nsometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could \\r\\nread minds. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry knew, when they wished Harry good luck \\r\\noutside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ronand Hermione were wondering whether Ron \\r\\nand Hermione’d ever \\r\\nsee Harry alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call \\r\\ncomforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep \\r\\ntalk as Harry pulled on his robes and picked \\r\\nup Harry Nimbus Two Thousand. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in \\r\\nthe stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand \\r\\nwhy Ron and Hermione looked so grim and worried, or why Ron and Hermione had \\r\\nRon and Hermione brought Ron and Hermione wands to the match. Little did \\r\\nHarry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly \\r\\npracticing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the \\r\\nidea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready \\r\\nto use it on Snape if Snape showed any sign of wanting to \\r\\nhurt Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermionemuttered as Ron slipped Ron wand up Ron sleeve. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harryaside. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever \\r\\nneed an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 248 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too \\r\\nmuch.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, \\r\\npeering out of the door. “Even — blimey — \\r\\nSnape’s come to watch!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s heart did a somersault. \\r\\n\\r\\nDumbledore gentlyDumbledore gently?” Dumbledore gently said, dashing to the door to make \\r\\nsure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that \\r\\nsilver beard. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief. Harry was \\r\\nsafe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare \\r\\nto try to hurt Harry if Dumbledore gently was watching. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as \\r\\nthe teams marched onto the field, something that Ronnoticed, too. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” Snape told \\r\\nHermione. “Look — they’re off. Ouch!” \\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It \\r\\nwas Malfoy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wonder how long Snape’s going to stay on Snape’s broom \\r\\nthis time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, \\r\\nWeasley?” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded \\r\\nHufflepuff a penalty because Weasley had hit \\r\\na Bludger at Weasley. Hermione, who had all her fingers \\r\\ncrossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 249 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwho was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the \\r\\nSnitch. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You know how I think they choose people for the \\r\\nGryffindor team?” said ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy loudly a few minutes \\r\\nlater, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty \\r\\nfor no reason at all. “It’s people people feel sorry for. \\r\\n\\r\\nSee, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s \\r\\nthe Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be \\r\\non the \\r\\nGryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face \\r\\nMalfoy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m worth twelve of you, ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy,” Neville stammered. \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but \\r\\nRon, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, \\r\\nsaid, “You tell Ron, Neville.” \\r\\n\\r\\nLongbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking \\r\\npoint with anxiety about Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What? Where?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, \\r\\nwhich drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. \\r\\nHermione stood up, Hermione crossed fingers in Hermione mouth, \\r\\nas Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re in luck, Weasley, Snape’s obviously spotted \\r\\nsome money on the ground!” said ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 250 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRon snapped. Before ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy knew what was \\r\\nhappening, Ron was on top of Ron, wrestling Ron to \\r\\nthe ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the \\r\\nback of his seat to help. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto \\r\\nher seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — \\r\\nher didn’t even notice ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy and Ron rolling around \\r\\nunder her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from \\r\\nthe whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. \\r\\n\\r\\nUp in the air, Snape turned on Snape broomstick just in \\r\\ntime to see something scarlet shoot past Snape, missing \\r\\nSnape by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled \\r\\nout of the dive, Harry arm raised in triumph, the Snitchclasped in the Snitch hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe stands erupted; The stands had to be a record, no one \\r\\ncould ever remember the Snitch being caught so \\r\\nquickly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s \\r\\nwon! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked \\r\\nHermione, dancing up and down on her seat and \\r\\nhugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry jumped off Harry broom, a foot from the ground. \\r\\nHarry couldn’t believe it. He’d done it — The game was \\r\\nover; The game had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors \\r\\ncame spilling onto the field, Gryffindors \\r\\n saw Snape land \\r\\nnearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt \\r\\na hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into \\r\\nDumbledore’s smiling face. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well done,” said Dumbledore gently quietly, so that Harry Harry could hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been \\r\\nbrooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . \\r\\nexcellent ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 251 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJc Jc Jc \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to \\r\\ntake Harry Nimbus Two Thousand back to the \\r\\nbroomshed. Harry couldn’t ever remember feeling \\r\\nhappier. He’d really done something to be proud of \\r\\nnow — no one could say Harry was just a famous name \\r\\nany more. The evening air had never smelled so \\r\\nsweet. Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the \\r\\nlast hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: \\r\\nGryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; \\r\\nRon and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and \\r\\ndown, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had reached the shed. Harry leaned against the \\r\\nwooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with the \\r\\nwooden door \\r\\nwindows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in \\r\\nthe lead. He’d done Gryffindor in \\r\\nthe lead, Harry’d shown Snape. ... \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd speaking of Snape . . . \\r\\n\\r\\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of \\r\\nthe castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, A hooded figure walked \\r\\nas fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. \\r\\nHarry’s victory faded from Harry’s mind as Harry’s watched. \\r\\nHarry’s recognized A hooded figure prowling walk. Snape, \\r\\nsneaking into the forbidden forest while everyone else was at \\r\\ndinner — what was going on? \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry jumped back on Harry Nimbus Two Thousand \\r\\nand took off. Gliding silently over the castle Harry saw \\r\\nSnape enter the forbidden forest at a run. Harry followed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe trees were so thick Harry couldn’t see where Snapehad gone. Harry flew in circles, lower and lower, \\r\\nbrushing the top branches of trees until Harry heard \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 252 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nvoices. Harry glided toward he heard \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 252 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nvoices and landed noiselessly \\r\\nin a towering beech tree. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry climbed carefully along one of the branches, \\r\\nholding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through \\r\\nthe leaves. \\r\\n\\r\\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but Harry \\r\\nwasn’t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t \\r\\nmake out the look on Harry face, but Harry was stuttering \\r\\nworse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they \\r\\nwere saying. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of \\r\\nall p-places, Severus ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, Snape \\r\\nvoice icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about \\r\\nthe Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling \\r\\nsomething. Snape interrupted Snape. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you found out how to get past that beast of \\r\\nHagrid’s yet?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“B-b-but Severus, I — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said \\r\\nSnape, taking a step toward Snape. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I-I don’t know what you — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You know perfectly well what I mean.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the \\r\\ntree. An owl steadied An owl in time to hear Snape say, \\r\\n\\r\\n“ — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 253 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“B-b-but I d-d-don’t — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” Snape cut in. “Well have another little \\r\\nchat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over \\r\\nand decided where your loyalties lie.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSnape threw Snape cloak over Snape head and strode out of a shadowy clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see \\r\\nQuirrell, standing quite still as though Harry was \\r\\npetrified. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJc Jc Jc \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping \\r\\nHarry on the back. “And I gave ” \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy a black eye, \\r\\nand Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- \\r\\nhanded! Snape’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says \\r\\nSnape’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! \\r\\nEveryone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re \\r\\nhaving a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and \\r\\nstuff from the kitchens.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s \\r\\nfind an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n’s \\r\\n made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting \\r\\nthe door behind them, then ’s \\r\\n told them what ’s \\r\\n’d \\r\\nseen and heard. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and \\r\\nSnape’s trying to force Quirrell to help Snape’s get Quirrell. Snape’s \\r\\nasked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said \\r\\nsomething about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon \\r\\nthere are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from \\r\\nFluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 254 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Snapewas sweeping about in Snape usual bad temper, which \\r\\nsurely meant that the Sorcerer’s Stone was still safe. Whenever \\r\\nHarry passed Quirrell these days Harry gave Harry an \\r\\nencouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling \\r\\npeople off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione, however, had more on Hermione mind than the \\r\\nSorcerer’s Stone. Hermione had started drawing up study \\r\\nschedules and color-coding all Hermione notes. Harry and \\r\\nRon wouldn’t have minded, but Hermione kept nagging \\r\\nHarry and \\r\\nRon to do the same. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 256 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hermione, the exams are ages away.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, \\r\\nthat’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded \\r\\nHermione. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already \\r\\nknow it all.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize \\r\\nwe need to pass the exams to get into the second \\r\\nyear? the exams’re very important, I should have started \\r\\nstudying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into \\r\\nme.” \\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking \\r\\nalong the same lines as Hermione. the teachers piled so \\r\\nmuch homework on the teachers that the Easter holidays \\r\\nweren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It \\r\\nwas hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting \\r\\nthe twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand \\r\\nmovements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ronspent most of their free time in the library with Harry, \\r\\ntrying to get through all their extra work. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one \\r\\nafternoon, throwing down Ron quill and looking \\r\\nlongingly out of the library window. It was the first \\r\\nreally fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a \\r\\nclear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in \\r\\nthe air of summer coming. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand \\r\\nMagical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until Ron \\r\\nheard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing in the \\r\\nlibrary?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 257 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind \\r\\nRon back. Ron looked very out of place in Ron moleskin \\r\\novercoat. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Jus’ lookin’,” Ron said, in a shifty voice that got their \\r\\ninterest at once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” Ron \\r\\nlooked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer \\r\\nNicolas Flamel, are yeh?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, we found out who Nicolas Flamel is ages ago,” said Ronimpressively. “And we know what that dog’s guarding, \\r\\nit’s a the \\r\\nSorcerer’s Stone’s St — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shhhh\\\\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if \\r\\nanyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about shoutin, \\r\\nwhat’s the matter with yeh?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a \\r\\nmatter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding \\r\\nthe Stone apart from Fluffy — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Sorcerer’s St — come an’ see \\r\\nme later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, \\r\\nbut don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ \\r\\ns’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“See you later, then,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid shuffled off. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What was Hagrid hiding behind Hagrid ?” said \\r\\nHermione thoughtfully. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you think it had anything to do with the Sorcerer’s Stone?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m going to see what section Hagrid was in,” said Ron, \\r\\nwho’d had enough of working. Hagrid came back a \\r\\nminute later with a pile of books in Hagrid arms and \\r\\nslammed them down on the table. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 258 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dragons\\'.” Page | 258 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dragons\\' whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff \\r\\nabout dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great \\r\\nBritain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon \\r\\nKeeper’s Guide.” \\r\\n\\r\\nit’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n always wanted a dragon, it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n told me so the \\r\\nfirst time I ever met a dragon,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon \\r\\nbreeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention \\r\\nof 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop \\r\\nMuggles from noticing us if us’re keeping dragons in \\r\\nthe back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, \\r\\nit’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got \\r\\noff wild ones in Romania.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh \\r\\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic \\r\\nhas a job hushing Common Welsh \\r\\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks up, I can tell you. us kind \\r\\nhave to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted \\r\\nCommon Welsh \\r\\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks, to make Common Welsh \\r\\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks forget.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Common Welsh \\r\\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s \\r\\nhut an hour later, Common Welsh \\r\\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks were surprised to see that all \\r\\nthe curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?” \\r\\nbefore he let Common Welsh \\r\\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks in, and then shut the door quickly \\r\\nbehind Common Welsh \\r\\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though It was such a \\r\\nwarm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid made them tea and offered them stoat \\r\\nsandwiches, which them refused. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 259 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around \\r\\nthe bush. “We were wondering if you could tell We \\r\\nwhat’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from \\r\\nFluffy.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid frowned at Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n“O’ course I can’t,” Hagrid said. “Number one, I don’ know \\r\\nmeself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I \\r\\nwouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good \\r\\nreason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I \\r\\ns’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how \\r\\nyeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell We, \\r\\nbut you do know, you know everything that goes on \\r\\nround here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering \\r\\nvoice. Hagrid ’s beard twitched and Hagrid ’s beard could tell Hagrid ’s beard \\r\\nwas smiling. “We only wondered who had done the \\r\\nguarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered \\r\\nwho Dumbledore had trusted enough to help Dumbledore, \\r\\napart from Dumbledore.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and \\r\\nRon beamed at Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... \\r\\nlet’s see ... Dumbledore borrowed Fluffy from Dumbledore ... then some \\r\\no’ the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout \\r\\n— Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” Dumbledore \\r\\nticked them off on Dumbledore fingers, “Professor Quirrell — \\r\\nan’ Dumbledore did somethin’, o’ course. \\r\\n\\r\\nHang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Snape.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Snape?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 260 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, \\r\\nSnape helped protect the Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape’s not about ter \\r\\nsteal ter \\r\\n.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry knew Ron, and Hermione were thinking the \\r\\nsame as Harry was. If Snape had been in on protecting \\r\\nthe Sorcerer’s Stone, Snape had been in on protecting \\r\\nthe Stone must have been easy to find out how the \\r\\nother teachers had guarded Snape had been in on protecting \\r\\nthe Stone. Snape probably knew \\r\\neverything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and \\r\\nhow to get past Fluffy. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re the only one who knows how to get past \\r\\nFluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even \\r\\none of the teachers?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said \\r\\nHagrid proudly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the \\r\\nothers. “Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m \\r\\nboiling.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed Harry \\r\\nglance at the fire. Harry looked at the fire, too. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid — what’s that?” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Harry already knew what it was. In the very heart of \\r\\nthe fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, \\r\\n“That’s — er ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching \\r\\nover the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg. “it must’ve \\r\\ncost you a fortune.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 261 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the \\r\\nvillage havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards \\r\\nwith a stranger. Think havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards \\r\\nwith a stranger was quite glad ter get rid of \\r\\nit, ter be honest.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But what are you going to do with it when it’s \\r\\nhatched?” said Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling \\r\\na large book from under Hagrid pillow. “Got this outta the \\r\\nlibrary — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — \\r\\nthis outta’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but this outta’s all in here. Keep \\r\\nthe egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on \\r\\n’em, see, an’ when this outta hatches, feed this outta on a bucket o’ \\r\\nbrandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ \\r\\nsee here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I \\r\\ngot there’s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They’re rare, \\r\\nThey.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked very pleased with He, but Hermionedidn’t. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid, you live in a wooden house,” Hermione said. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening. Hagrid was humming merrily \\r\\nas Hagrid stoked the fire. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what \\r\\nmight happen to Hagrid if anyone found out Hagrid was \\r\\nhiding an illegal dragon in Hagrid hut. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ronsighed, as evening after evening they struggled \\r\\nthrough all the extra homework they were getting. \\r\\nHermione had now started making study schedules \\r\\nfor Harry and \\r\\nRon, too. It was driving Harry and \\r\\nRon nuts. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 262 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry \\r\\nanother note from Hagrid. Harry \\r\\n had written only two \\r\\nwords: It’s a Norwegian Ridge-back hatching. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to \\r\\nhis hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of his hut. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione, how many times in our lives are our going \\r\\nto see a dragon hatching?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“our’ve got lessons, our’ll get into trouble, and that’s \\r\\nnothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone \\r\\nfinds out what someone \\r\\n’s doing — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut up!” Harry whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and Malfoy had stopped \\r\\ndead to listen. How much had Malfoy heard? Harry didn’t \\r\\nlike the look on Malfoy’s face at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon, and Hermione argued all the way to Herbologyand in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to \\r\\nHagrid’s with the other two during morning break. \\r\\nWhen the bell sounded from the castle at the end of \\r\\nRon, and Hermione lesson, the three of Ron, and Hermione dropped Ron, and Hermione trowels \\r\\nat once and hurried through the grounds to the edge \\r\\nof the forest. Hagrid greeted Ron, and Hermione, looking flushed \\r\\nand excited. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hagrid’s nearly out.” Hagrid ushered Ron, and Hermione inside. \\r\\n\\r\\na huge, black egg was lying on the table. There were deep \\r\\ncracks in a huge, black egg. Something was moving inside; a funny \\r\\nclicking noise was coming from a funny \\r\\nclicking noise. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey all drew They all chairs up to the table and watched \\r\\nwith bated breath. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 263 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and a huge, black eggsplit open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. The baby dragon \\r\\nwasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a \\r\\ncrumpled, black umbrella. it spiny wings were huge \\r\\ncompared to it skinny jet body, it had a long snout \\r\\nwith wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, \\r\\norange eyes. \\r\\n\\r\\nit sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of A couple of sparks snout. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Isn’t A couple of sparks beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. A couple of sparks reached \\r\\nout a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. The baby dragon snapped at \\r\\nA couple of sparks fingers, showing pointed fangs. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bless A couple of sparks, look, A couple of sparks knows A couple of sparks mommy!” said Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian \\r\\nRidgebacks grow, exactly?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly \\r\\ndrained from Hagrid face — Hagrid leapt to Hagrid feet and ran to \\r\\nthe window. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains \\r\\n— it’s a kid — it’s a kid runnin’ back up ter the school.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a \\r\\ndistance there was no mistaking Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy had seen The baby dragon. \\r\\n\\r\\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face \\r\\nduring the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous. Ron, and Hermione \\r\\nvery nervous spent most of Ron, and Hermione \\r\\nvery nervous free time in \\r\\nHagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with Hagrid ’s. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Just let Hagrid ’s go,” Harry urged. “Set Hagrid ’s free.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 264 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “Hagrid ’s’s too little. He’d die.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked at The baby dragon. The baby dragon had grown three times \\r\\nin length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of The baby dragon \\r\\nnostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing Hagrid gamekeeping \\r\\nduties because The baby dragon was keeping The baby dragon so busy. \\r\\nThere were empty brandy bottles and chicken \\r\\nfeathers all over the floor. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve decided to call The baby dragon Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking \\r\\nat The baby dragon with misty eyes. “The baby dragon really knows me \\r\\nnow, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mommy?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“The baby dragon’s lost The baby dragon marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and \\r\\n’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoycould go to Dumbledore at any moment.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid bit Hagrid lip. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I — I know I can’t keep Hagrid forever, but I can’t jus’ \\r\\ndump Hagrid, can’t.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Charlie,” Ron said. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “IRon, remember?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No “Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. \\r\\nStudying dragons. We could send Norbert to Norbert. \\r\\n“Charlie can take care of “Charlie and then put “Charlie back \\r\\nin the wild!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send \\r\\nan owl to “Charlie to ask “Charlie. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 265 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night \\r\\nfound Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the \\r\\ncommon room, long after everyone else had gone to \\r\\nbed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight \\r\\nwhen the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out \\r\\nof nowhere as Ron pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. \\r\\nRon had been down at Hagrid hut, helping Ron feed \\r\\nNorbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It bit me!” Ron said, showing them Ron hand, which \\r\\nwas wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going \\r\\nto be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that \\r\\ndragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but \\r\\nthe way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a \\r\\nfluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me Ron told me off \\r\\nfor frightening \\r\\n. And when I left, Ron was singing \\r\\n a \\r\\nlullaby.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a tap on the dark window. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let It’s Hedwig in. “It’s Hedwig’ll \\r\\nhave “Charlie’s answer!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe three of them put them heads together to read the \\r\\nnote. \\r\\n\\r\\nDear Ron, \\r\\n\\r\\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to \\r\\ntake the Norwegian Ridgeback, but the Norwegian Ridgeback won’t be easy \\r\\ngetting the Norwegian Ridgeback here. I think the best thing will be to send \\r\\nthe Norwegian Ridgeback over with some friends of mine who are coming to \\r\\nvisit me next week. Trouble is, Trouble mustn’t be seen \\r\\ncarrying an illegal dragon. \\r\\n\\r\\nCould you get the Norwegian Ridgeback up the tallest tower at \\r\\nmidnight on Saturday? Trouble can meet you there and \\r\\ntake the Norwegian Ridgeback away while it’s still dark. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 266 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSend me an answer as soon as possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLove, \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie \\r\\n\\r\\n266 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n looked at one another. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It \\r\\nshouldn’t be too difficult — I think it’s still dark big \\r\\nenough to cover two of We and Norbert.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that \\r\\nthe other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of \\r\\nNorbert — and Malfoy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, ’s bitten \\r\\nhand had swollen to twice its usual size. ’s didn’t \\r\\nknow whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey — \\r\\nwould Madam Pomfrey — \\r\\n recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, \\r\\nthough, ’s had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty \\r\\nshade of green. The cut looked as if Norbert’s fangs were \\r\\npoisonous. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon, and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing \\r\\nat the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in \\r\\nbed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not just my hand,” Ron whispered, “although that \\r\\nfeels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam \\r\\nPomfrey Malfoy wanted to borrow one of my books so Malfoy \\r\\ncould come and have a good laugh at Malfoy. Malfoy kept \\r\\nthreatening to tell Madam Pomfrey — \\r\\n what really bit me — I’ve told \\r\\nMadam Pomfrey — \\r\\n it was a dog, but I don’t think Madam Pomfrey — \\r\\n believes me — I \\r\\nshouldn’t have hit Malfoy at the Quidditch match, that’s \\r\\nwhy Malfoy’s doing this.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon, and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 267 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said \\r\\nHermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the \\r\\ncontrary, Ron sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Midnight on Saturday!” Ron said in a hoarse voice. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s \\r\\nletter was in Malfoy Malfoy took, it’s a kid going to \\r\\nknow we’re getting rid of Norbert.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon, and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. \\r\\nMadam \\r\\nPomfrey came over at that moment and made \\r\\nRon, and Hermione leave, saying Ron needed sleep. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told \\r\\nHermione. “We haven’t got time to send “Charlieanother owl, and this could be We only chance to get \\r\\nrid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And We have got \\r\\nthe Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about \\r\\nthat.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon, and Hermione found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a \\r\\nbandaged tail when Ron, and Hermione went to tell Hagrid, who \\r\\nopened a window to talk to Ron, and Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t let you in,” Norbert puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky \\r\\nstage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky \\r\\n letter, Norbert eyes \\r\\nfilled with tears, although that might have been \\r\\nbecause Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Aargh! It’s all right, Norbert only got my boot — jus’ \\r\\nplayin’ — Norbert’s only a baby, after all.” \\r\\n\\r\\nonly a baby banged only a baby tail on the wall, making the \\r\\nwindows rattle. Ron, and Hermione walked back to \\r\\nthe castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly \\r\\nenough. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 268 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRon, and Hermione would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time \\r\\ncame for Hagrid to say good-bye to Norbert if Ron, and Hermione hadn’t \\r\\nbeen so worried about what Ron, and Hermione had to do. It was a \\r\\nvery dark, cloudy night, and Ron, and Hermione were a bit late \\r\\narriving at Hagrid ’s hut because Ron, and Hermione’d had to wait for \\r\\nPeeves to get out of Ron, and Hermione way in the entrance hall, \\r\\nwhere he’d been playing tennis against the wall. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Norbert’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” \\r\\nsaid Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his \\r\\nteddy bear in case his gets lonely.” \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom inside a large crate came ripping noises that \\r\\nsounded to Harry as though his \\r\\nteddy was having his \\r\\nteddy \\r\\nhead torn off. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and \\r\\nHermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak \\r\\nand stepped underneath the Invisibility Cloak \\r\\n Harry and \\r\\nHermione. “Mommy will \\r\\nnever forget you!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHow Harry and \\r\\nHermione managed to get a large crate back up to the \\r\\ncastle, Harry and \\r\\nHermione never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as \\r\\nHarry and \\r\\nHermione heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the \\r\\nentrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up \\r\\nanother staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s \\r\\nshortcuts didn’t make the work much easier. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nearly there!” Harry panted as Harry and \\r\\nHermione reached the \\r\\ncorridor beneath the tallest tower. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen a sudden movement ahead of Harry and \\r\\nHermione made Harry and \\r\\nHermione \\r\\nalmost drop a large crate. Forgetting that Harry and \\r\\nHermione were \\r\\nalready invisible, Harry and \\r\\nHermione shrank into the shadows, \\r\\nstaring at the dark outlines of two people grappling \\r\\nwith each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 269 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair \\r\\nnet, had Malfoy by the ear. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Detention!” Malfoy shouted. “And twenty points from \\r\\nSlytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the \\r\\nnight, how dare you — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s \\r\\ncoming — Professor’s got a dragon!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! \\r\\nCome on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, \\r\\nMalfoy!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the Astronomy Towerseemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not \\r\\nuntil they’d stepped out into the cold night air did \\r\\nthey throw off the Invisibility Cloak \\r\\n, glad to be able to breathe \\r\\nproperly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t,” Harry advised her. \\r\\n\\r\\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbertthrashing about in a large crate. About ten minutes later, \\r\\nfour broomsticks came swooping down out of the \\r\\ndarkness. \\r\\n\\r\\nNorbert’s at a tricky \\r\\n friends were a cheery lot. Charlie’s friends showed \\r\\nHarry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so \\r\\nCharlie’s friends could suspend Norbert between Charlie’s friends. They all \\r\\nhelped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry \\r\\nand Hermione shook hands with the others and \\r\\nthanked Harry \\r\\nand Hermione very much. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 270 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry \\r\\nand Hermione slipped back down the spiral staircase, Harry \\r\\nand Hermione \\r\\nhearts as light as Harry \\r\\nand Hermione hands, now that Norbert was \\r\\noff Harry \\r\\nand Hermione. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — \\r\\nwhat could spoil Harry \\r\\nand Hermione happiness? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the \\r\\nstairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face \\r\\nloomed suddenly out of the darkness. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, well,” Norbert whispered, “we are in trouble.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 271 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FORBIDDEN FOREST \\r\\n\\r\\nThings couldn’t have been worse. \\r\\n\\r\\nFilch took Things down to Professor McGonagall’s \\r\\nstudy on the first floor, where Things sat and waited \\r\\nwithout saying a word to each other. Hermione was \\r\\ntrembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories \\r\\nchased each other around Harry’s brain, each more \\r\\nfeeble than the last. Harry couldn’t see how Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories \\r\\n were \\r\\ngoing to get out of trouble this time. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories \\r\\n were \\r\\ncornered. How could Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories \\r\\n have been so stupid as to \\r\\nforget the Invisibility Cloak \\r\\n? There was no reason on earth that \\r\\nProfessor McGonagall would accept for their being out \\r\\nof bed and creeping around the school in the dead of \\r\\nnight, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, \\r\\nwhich was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add \\r\\nNorbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and Add \\r\\nNorbert and the Invisibility Cloak might as \\r\\nwell be packing Add \\r\\nNorbert and the Invisibility Cloak bags already. \\r\\n\\r\\nHad Harry thought that things couldn’t have been \\r\\nworse? Harry was wrong. When Professor McGonagallappeared, Professor McGonagall was leading Neville. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 272 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment Neville saw the \\r\\nother two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I \\r\\nheard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy \\r\\nsaid you had a drag — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but \\r\\nProfessor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen. a drag — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked more \\r\\nlikely to breathe fire than Norbert as a drag — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry towered over \\r\\nthe three of them. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I would never have believed it of any of you. Filchsays you were up in the Astronomy Tower. it’s one \\r\\no’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to \\r\\nanswer a teacher’s question. a drag — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was staring at a drag — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry \\r\\nslippers, as still as a statue. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” \\r\\nsaid Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius \\r\\nto work It out. You fed Malfoy some cock-and- \\r\\nbull story about a dragon, trying to get Malfoy out of bed \\r\\nand into trouble. I’ve already caught Malfoy. I suppose \\r\\nyou think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the \\r\\nstory and believed the \\r\\nstory, too?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell Harry \\r\\nwithout words that this wasn’t true, because Nevillewas looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering \\r\\nNeville Harry knew what it must have cost Harry to \\r\\ntry and find Neville \\r\\nwas looking stunned and hurt in the dark, to warn Neville \\r\\nwas looking stunned and hurt. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four \\r\\nstudents out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of \\r\\nsuch a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you \\r\\nhad more sense. As for you, Harry Potter’s \\r\\n, I thought \\r\\nGryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of \\r\\nyou will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. \\r\\nLongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk \\r\\nPage | 273 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\naround school at night, especially these days, it’s very \\r\\ndangerous — and fifty points will be taken from \\r\\nGryffindor.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the \\r\\nlead he’d won in the last Quidditch match. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, \\r\\nbreathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Professor — please — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t—” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Harry Potter’s \\r\\n. Now get \\r\\nback to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed \\r\\nof Gryffindor students.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in \\r\\nlast place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance \\r\\nGryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as \\r\\nthough the bottom had dropped out of Harry stomach. \\r\\nHow could they ever make up for this? \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry didn’t sleep all night. Harry could hear Nevillesobbing into Harry pillow for what seemed like hours. \\r\\nHarry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort \\r\\nHarry. Harry knew Neville, like Harry, was dreading the \\r\\ndawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done? \\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses \\r\\nthat recorded the House points the next day thought \\r\\nthere ’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly \\r\\nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? \\r\\nAnd then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, \\r\\nthe famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch \\r\\nmatches, had lost their all those points, him and a \\r\\ncouple of other stupid first years. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 274 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired \\r\\npeople at the school, Harry was suddenly the most \\r\\nhated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on \\r\\nHarry, because everyone had been longing to see \\r\\nSlytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harrywent, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower people \\r\\nvoices as people insulted Harry. Slytherins, on the other \\r\\nhand, clapped as Harry walked past them, whistling and \\r\\ncheering, “Harry Potter’s \\r\\n, we owe you one!” \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly Ron stood by Only Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“people’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George \\r\\nhave lost loads of points in all the time Fred and George \\r\\n’ve been \\r\\nhere, and people still like Fred and George \\r\\n.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Fred and George \\r\\n’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one \\r\\ngo, though, have Fred and George \\r\\n?” said Harry miserably. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well — no,” Only Ron admitted. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harryswore to Harry not to meddle in things that weren’t \\r\\nHarry business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking \\r\\naround and spying. Harry felt so ashamed of Harry that \\r\\nHarry went to Wood and offered to resign from the \\r\\nQuidditch team. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? \\r\\n\\r\\nHow are we going to get any points back if we can’t \\r\\nwin at Quidditch?” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Quidditch Quidditch had lost Quidditch fun. The rest of the \\r\\nQuidditch team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if \\r\\nThe rest of the \\r\\nteam had to speak about Harry, The rest of the \\r\\nteam called Harry “the \\r\\nSeeker.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. Hermione and Neville didn’t \\r\\nhave as bad a time as Harry, because Hermione and Neville weren’t as \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 275 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwell-known, but nobody would speak to Hermione and Neville, either. \\r\\nHermione had stopped drawing attention to Hermione in \\r\\nclass, keeping Hermione head down and working in silence. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far \\r\\naway. All the studying Harry had to do kept Harry mind off \\r\\nHarry misery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept to \\r\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione, working late into the night, trying to \\r\\nremember the ingredients in complicated potions, \\r\\nlearn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates \\r\\nof magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ... \\r\\n\\r\\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to \\r\\nstart, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in \\r\\nanything that didn’t concern him was put to an \\r\\nunexpected test. Walking back from the library on Harry \\r\\nown one afternoon, Harry heard somebody whimpering \\r\\nfrom a classroom up ahead. As Harry drew closer, Harry \\r\\nheard Quirrell’s voice. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No — no — not again, please — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening someone. \\r\\nHarry moved closer. \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right — all right — ” Harry heard Quirrell sob. \\r\\n\\r\\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the \\r\\nclassroom straightening Quirrell turban. Quirrell was pale and \\r\\nlooked as though Quirrell was about to cry. Quirrell strode out \\r\\nof sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed \\r\\nQuirrell. Quirrell waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had \\r\\ndisappeared, then peered into the \\r\\nclassroom straightening his turban. It was \\r\\nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harrywas halfway toward a door before Harry remembered what \\r\\nHarry’d promised Harry about not meddling. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll the same, Harry’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s \\r\\nStones that Snape had just left the room, and from \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 276 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking \\r\\nwith a new spring in Snape step Quirrell seemed to \\r\\nhave given in at last. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was \\r\\ntesting Ron on Astronomy. Harry told the library, where Hermione was \\r\\ntesting Ron on Astronomy what Harry’d \\r\\nheard. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Snapedone it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told \\r\\nRon how to break Ron Anti-Dark Force spell — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe Snapefound out how to get past Snape \\r\\nwithout asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the \\r\\nthousands of books surrounding asking Hagrid. “I bet there’s a \\r\\nbook somewhere in here telling you how to get past a \\r\\ngiant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Harry’seyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done \\r\\nages ago. If we try anything we we’ll be thrown \\r\\nout for sure.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too \\r\\nscared to back we up. Snapeonly got to say Snape \\r\\ndoesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and \\r\\nthat Snape was nowhere near the third floor — who do \\r\\nyou think the troll’ll believe, Snape or we? It’s not exactly a \\r\\nsecret we hate Snape, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it \\r\\nup to get Dumbledore sacked. Filch wouldn’t help we if Filch life \\r\\ndepended on his life \\r\\n, Filch’s too friendly with Snape, and the \\r\\nmore students get thrown out, the better, Filch’ll think. \\r\\nAnd don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about \\r\\nthe Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione looked convinced, but Only Ron didn’t. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 277 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we just do a bit of poking around — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said Harry flatly, ““’ve done enough poking \\r\\naround.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry pulled a map of Jupiter toward Harry and started to \\r\\nlearn the names of \\r\\n moons. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, \\r\\nHermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They \\r\\nwere all the same: \\r\\n\\r\\nYour detention will take place at eleven o’clock \\r\\ntonight. \\r\\n\\r\\nMeet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in \\r\\nthe furor over the points they’d lost. ’d half expected \\r\\nHermione to complain that this was a whole night of \\r\\nstudying lost, but Hermione didn’t say a word. Like Harry, \\r\\nHermione felt they deserved what they’d got. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Only Ronin the common room and went down to the entrance \\r\\nhall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so \\r\\nwas Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had \\r\\ngotten a detention, too. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading \\r\\nMalfoy had \\r\\ngotten a detention, too outside. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule \\r\\nagain, won’t you, eh?” Harry said, leering at Malfoy had \\r\\ngotten a detention, too. “Oh \\r\\nyes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you \\r\\nask me. ... It’s just a pity they let the old \\r\\npunishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from \\r\\nPage | 278 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in \\r\\nmy office, keep ’em well oiled in case the chains’re ever \\r\\nneeded. ... Right, off we go, and don’t think of running \\r\\noff, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe chains marched off across the dark grounds. Neville \\r\\nkept sniffing. Harry wondered what the chains punishment \\r\\nwas going to be. It must be something really horrible, \\r\\nor Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across The moon \\r\\nkept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harrycould see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then \\r\\nthey heard a distant shout. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working \\r\\nwith Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. Hagrid relief must \\r\\nhave showed in Hagrid face, because Filch said, “I \\r\\nsuppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with \\r\\nthat oaf? Well, think again, boy — that oaf’s into the forest \\r\\nyou’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come \\r\\nout in one piece.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAt this, Neville \\r\\n let out a little moan, and Malfoy \\r\\nstopped dead in Neville \\r\\n tracks. \\r\\n\\r\\n“the forest \\r\\n?” Malfoy \\r\\n repeated, and Malfoy \\r\\n didn’t sound quite \\r\\nas cool as usual. “We can’t go in there at night — \\r\\nthere’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I \\r\\nheard.” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville \\r\\n clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a \\r\\nchoking noise. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, Filch voice \\r\\ncracking with glee. “Should’ve thought of them \\r\\nwerewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 279 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, \\r\\nFang at Fang heel. Fang was carrying Fang large crossbow, \\r\\nand a quiver of arrows hung over Fang shoulder. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Abou’ time,” Fang said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour \\r\\nalready. All right, Harry, Hermione?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I shouldn’t be too friendly to All right, Harry, Hermione?” \\r\\n\\r\\n, Hagrid,” said \\r\\nFilch coldly, “All right, Harry, Hermione?” \\r\\n\\r\\n’re here to be punished, after all.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at \\r\\nFilch. “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do \\r\\nthat. Bin lecturin done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of \\r\\nthem,” he added nastily, and he turned and started \\r\\nback toward the castle, he lamp bobbing away in the \\r\\ndarkness. \\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not going in that forest,” ’m said, and Harry was \\r\\npleased to hear the note of panic in Harry voice. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry are if Harry want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said \\r\\nHagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now Yeh’ve got \\r\\nter pay fer it.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But this is servant stuff, this’s not for students to do. I \\r\\nthought we’d be copying lines or something, if my \\r\\nfather knew I was doing this, my \\r\\nfather’d — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagridgrowled. “Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone? \\r\\nYeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If Harry think \\r\\nyer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back \\r\\noff ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy didn’t move. Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy looked at Hagrid furiously, but \\r\\nthen dropped Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy gaze. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, \\r\\n\\r\\n’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ \\r\\nI don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a \\r\\nmoment.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy led that to the very edge of the forest. Holding Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy \\r\\nlamp up high, Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy pointed down a narrow, winding \\r\\nearth track that disappeared into the thick black \\r\\ntrees. A light breeze lifted that hair as that looked \\r\\ninto the forest. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on \\r\\nthe ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. \\r\\nThere’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. \\r\\nThis is the second time in a week. I found one dead \\r\\nlast Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor \\r\\nthing. We might have ter put ter out of ter misery.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds We \\r\\nfirst?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of Malfoy \\r\\nvoice. \\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh \\r\\nif yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the \\r\\npath. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties \\r\\nan’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood \\r\\nall over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around \\r\\nsince last night at least.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s \\r\\nlong teeth. \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, but I warn yeh, Malfoy’s a coward,” said Hagrid. \\r\\n“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, \\r\\nNeville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us \\r\\nfinds the unicorn, us’ll send up green sparks, right? \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 281 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGet yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s that’s — an’ \\r\\nif anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll \\r\\nall come an’ find Harry — so, be careful — let’s go.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into The forest \\r\\nthey reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, \\r\\nHermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, \\r\\nNeville, and Fang took the right. \\r\\n\\r\\nthey walked in silence, they eyes on the ground. \\r\\nEvery now and then a ray of moonlight through the \\r\\nbranches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the \\r\\nfallen leaves. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \\r\\n\\r\\n“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harryasked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch \\r\\na unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never \\r\\nknew one ter be hurt before.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could \\r\\nhear running water; there must be a stream \\r\\nsomewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn \\r\\nblood here and there along the winding path. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ \\r\\nworry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ \\r\\nthen well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted Harry and Hermione \\r\\noff the path behind a towering oak. Hagrid pulled out an \\r\\narrow and fitted an \\r\\narrow into Hagrid crossbow, raising an \\r\\narrow, ready \\r\\nto fire. The three of Harry and Hermione listened. Something was \\r\\nslithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a \\r\\ncloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 282 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nup the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound \\r\\nfaded away. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew it,” Page | 282 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nup the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound \\r\\nfaded away. \\r\\n\\r\\n murmured. “There’s summat in here \\r\\nthat shouldn’ be.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“A werewolf?” Harry suggested. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, \\r\\nneither,” said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but \\r\\ncareful, now.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the \\r\\nfaintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, \\r\\nsomething definitely moved. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m \\r\\narmed!” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd into a clearing ahead came — was it a man, or a \\r\\nhorse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, \\r\\nbut below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body \\r\\nwith a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws \\r\\ndropped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid. “How are \\r\\nHarry?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. Ronan had a \\r\\ndeep, sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting Ronan \\r\\ncrossbow. “There’s summat bad loose in this forest. \\r\\nThis is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the \\r\\nway. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, \\r\\nyou two. Harry’s a centaur.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 283 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And \\r\\ndo you learn much, up at the school?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Erm — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“A bit,” said Hermione timidly. \\r\\n\\r\\n“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He \\r\\nflung back He head and stared at the sky. “Mars is \\r\\nbright tonight.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad \\r\\nwe’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn \\r\\nbin hurt — you seen anythin’?” \\r\\n\\r\\nRonan didn’t answer immediately. Ronan stared \\r\\nunblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Always the innocent are the first victims,” Ronan said. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, \\r\\nRonan? Anythin’ unusual?” \\r\\n\\r\\nMars Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while \\r\\nHagrid watched Ronan impatiently. “Unusually bright.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit \\r\\nnearer home,” said Hagrid. “So Ronan haven’t noticed \\r\\nanythin’ strange?” \\r\\n\\r\\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, Ronan \\r\\nsaid, “The forest hides many secrets.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagridraise Hagrid bow again, but Hagrid was only a second centaur, \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 284 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nblack-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than \\r\\nRonan. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you \\r\\nseen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn \\r\\nbin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” \\r\\n\\r\\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. Bane looked \\r\\nskyward. \\r\\n\\r\\nMars Mars is bright tonight,” Bane said simply. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of \\r\\nyou do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be \\r\\noff, then.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry and Hermione followed Harry out of a clearing ahead, \\r\\nstaring over Harry and Hermione shoulders at Ronan and Bane until \\r\\nthe trees blocked Harry and Hermione view. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight \\r\\nanswer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not \\r\\ninterested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Are there many of Harry and Hermione in here?” asked Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep Harry and Hermione to Harry and Hermione \\r\\nmostly, but Harry and Hermione’re good enough about turnin’ up if \\r\\never I want a word. Harry and Hermione’re deep, mind, centaurs ... \\r\\nHarry and Hermione know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” \\r\\nsaid Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 285 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask \\r\\nme, that was what’s killin’ the unicorns — never \\r\\nheard anythin’ like it before.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe unicorns walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harrykept looking nervously over Harry shoulder. Harry had the \\r\\nnasty feeling the unicorns were being watched. Harry was very \\r\\nglad the unicorns had Hagrid and Harry crossbow with the unicorns. \\r\\nthe unicorns had just passed a bend in the path when \\r\\nHermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the \\r\\npath, I’ll come back for Harry!” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe unicorns heard Harry crashing away through the \\r\\nundergrowth and stood looking at each other, very \\r\\nscared, until the unicorns couldn’t hear anything but the \\r\\nrustling of leaves around the unicorns. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t think the unicorns’ve been hurt, do you?” \\r\\nwhispered Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got \\r\\nNeville ... it’s ’m fault Harry’s here in the first place.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper \\r\\nthan usual. he’s here in the first place.” \\r\\n\\r\\n seemed to be picking up every \\r\\nsigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going \\r\\non? Where were the others? \\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s \\r\\nreturn. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with Fang. \\r\\nHagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked \\r\\nup behind Neville and grabbed Neville as a joke. Nevillehad panicked and sent up Red sparks. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 286 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket \\r\\nyou two were makin’. Right, ’m’re changin’ groups — \\r\\nNeville, you stay with Neville an’ Hermione, Harry, you go \\r\\nwith Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,Hagrid added in a \\r\\nwhisper to Harry, “but Harry’ll have a harder time \\r\\nfrightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with \\r\\nMalfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an \\r\\nhour, deeper and deeper into The forest, until the path \\r\\nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees \\r\\nwere so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be \\r\\ngetting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a \\r\\ntree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing \\r\\naround in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing \\r\\nahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient \\r\\noak. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Look — ” Harry murmured, holding out Harry arm to stop \\r\\nMalfoy. \\r\\n\\r\\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. \\r\\nSomething bright white inched closer. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the unicorn all right, and It was dead. Harryhad never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Harry \\r\\nlong, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where \\r\\nHarry had fallen and Harry mane was spread pearly-white on \\r\\nthe dark leaves. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had taken one step toward Harry when a slithering \\r\\nsound made Harry freeze where Harry stood. A bush on \\r\\nthe edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the \\r\\nshadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the \\r\\nground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and \\r\\nFang stood transfixed. a hooded figure reached the \\r\\nunicorn, lowered a hooded figure head over the wound in the \\r\\nanimals side, and began to drink a hooded figure blood. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 287 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! ” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did \\r\\nFang. a hooded figure raised its head and looked \\r\\nright at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down a hooded figure \\r\\nfront. a hooded figure got to a hooded figure feet and came swiftly toward Harry — Harry — couldn’t move for fear. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen a pain like Harry —’d never felt before pierced Harry — \\r\\nhead; it was as though Harry — scar were on fire. Half \\r\\nblinded, Harry — staggered backward. Harry — heard hooves \\r\\nbehind Harry —, galloping, and something jumped clean \\r\\nover Harry, charging at a hooded figure. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pain in Harry’s head was so bad Harry fell to Harry \\r\\nknees. It took a minute or two to pass. When Harry \\r\\nlooked up, a hooded figure had gone. A centaur was \\r\\nstanding over Harry, not Ronan or Bane; this one \\r\\nlooked younger; Harry had white-blond hair and a \\r\\npalomino body. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to \\r\\nits feet. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes — thank you — what was that?” \\r\\n\\r\\nA centaur didn’t answer. Harry had astonishingly blue \\r\\neyes, like pale sapphires. Harry looked carefully at \\r\\nHarry, astonishingly blue \\r\\neyes lingering on the scar that stood out, \\r\\nlivid, on Harry’s forehead. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You are the Potter boy,” Harry said. “You had better get \\r\\nback to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — \\r\\nespecially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker \\r\\nthis way. \\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Firenze,” My name added, as My name lowered \\r\\nMy name on to My name front legs so that Harry could \\r\\nclamber onto Harry back. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 288 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from \\r\\nthe other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came \\r\\nbursting through the trees, Ronan and Bane flanks heaving and \\r\\nsweaty. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You \\r\\nhave a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are \\r\\nyou a common mule?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the \\r\\nPotter boy. The quicker the \\r\\nPotter boy leaves The forest, the \\r\\nbetter.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What have you been telling the \\r\\nPotter boy?” growled Bane. \\r\\n“Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set \\r\\nwe against the heavens. Have we not read what \\r\\nis to come in the movements of the planets?” \\r\\n\\r\\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze \\r\\nthought Ronan was acting for the best,” Ronan said in Ronan \\r\\ngloomy voice. \\r\\n\\r\\nBane kicked Bane back legs in anger. \\r\\n\\r\\n“For the best! What is that to do with we? Centaurs \\r\\nare concerned with what has been foretold! It is not \\r\\nwe business to run around like donkeys after stray \\r\\nhumans in we forest!Firenze suddenly reared on to Firenze hind legs in anger, \\r\\nso that Harry had to grab Harry shoulders to stay on. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or \\r\\nhave the planets not let you in on that secret? I set \\r\\nmyself against what is lurking in The forest, Bane, \\r\\nyes, with humans alongside myself if I must.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 289 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on \\r\\nas best Harry could, they plunged off into the trees, \\r\\nleaving Ronan and Bane behind Ronan and Bane. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry didn’t have a clue what was going on. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why’s Bane so angry?” Harry asked. “What was that \\r\\nthing you saved me from, anyway?Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep Harry \\r\\nhead bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did \\r\\nnot answer Harry’s question. They made They way \\r\\nthrough the trees in silence for so long that Harrythought Firenze didn’t want to talk to Harry anymore. \\r\\nThey were passing through a particularly dense patch \\r\\nof trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry PotterHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is \\r\\nused for?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve \\r\\nonly used the horn and tail hair in Potions.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a \\r\\nunicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to \\r\\nlose, and everything to gain, would commit such a \\r\\ncrime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even \\r\\nif you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. \\r\\nYou have slain something pure and defenseless to \\r\\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a \\r\\ncursed life, from the moment The blood of a unicorn touches your \\r\\nlips.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was \\r\\ndappled silver in the moonlight. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But who’d be that desperate?” Harry wondered aloud. “If \\r\\nyou’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t \\r\\n\\r\\n?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 290 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay \\r\\nalive long enough to drink something else — \\r\\nsomething that will bring you back to full strength \\r\\nand power — something that will mean you can never \\r\\ndie. Harry Potter, do you know what is hidden in the \\r\\nschool at this very moment?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! \\r\\nBut I don’t understand who — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years \\r\\nto return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting \\r\\ntheir chance?” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly \\r\\naround he’s here in the first place.” \\r\\n\\r\\n heart. Over the rustling of the trees, \\r\\nHarry seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told \\r\\nHarry on the night they had met: “Some say Harry died. \\r\\nCodswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if Harry had enough \\r\\nhuman left in Harry to die.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was VoZ — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarryHarry! Harry, are you all right?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, \\r\\nHagrid puffing along behind Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what Harry was \\r\\nsaying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, The unicorn’s dead’s in that \\r\\nclearing back there.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as \\r\\nHagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are \\r\\nsafe now.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry slid off Harry back. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 291 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets \\r\\nhave been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. \\r\\nI hope this is one of those times.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry turned and cantered back into the depths of the \\r\\nforest, leaving Harry shivering behind Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had fallen asleep in the dark common room, \\r\\nwaiting for them to return. Harry shouted something \\r\\nabout Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook Harry \\r\\nawake. In a matter of seconds, though, Harry was wide- \\r\\neyed as Harry began to tell Harry and Hermione what \\r\\nhad happened in the forest. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. Harry paced up and down in \\r\\nfront of the fire. Harry was still shaking. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and \\r\\nThe unicorn’s dead waiting in the forest ... and all this time \\r\\nwe thought “Snape just wanted to get rich. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Harry in a terrified \\r\\nwhisper, as if Harry thought Voldemort could hear them. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry wasn’t listening. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirenze saved me, but Firenze shouldn’t have done so. ... \\r\\nBane was furious ... Bane was talking about interfering \\r\\nwith what the planets say is going to happen. ... the planets \\r\\nmust show that Voldemortcoming back. ... Banethinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I \\r\\nsuppose thathe’s here in the first place.” \\r\\n\\r\\n written in the stars as well.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you stop saying the name\\\\” Harry hissed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So all I’ve got to wait for now is “Snape to steal The Sorcerer’s Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will \\r\\nbe able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose \\r\\nBane 11 be happy.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 292 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHermione looked very frightened, but Hermione had a word \\r\\nof comfort. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one \\r\\nYou-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore \\r\\naround, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, \\r\\nwho says the centaurs are right? It sounds like \\r\\nfortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says \\r\\nthat’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. \\r\\nthey went to bed exhausted, they throats sore. But \\r\\nthe night’s surprises weren’t over. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Harry pulled back Harry sheets, Harry found Harry \\r\\nInvisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath his sheets. \\r\\nThere was a note pinned to his \\r\\nInvisibility Cloak: \\r\\n\\r\\nJust in case. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 293 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR \\r\\n\\r\\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember \\r\\nhow Harry had managed to get through Harry exams when \\r\\nHarry half expected Voldemort to come bursting through \\r\\nthe door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and \\r\\nthere could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and \\r\\nwell behind the locked door. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large \\r\\nclassroom where they did they written papers. they \\r\\nhad been given special, new quills for the exams, \\r\\nwhich had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating \\r\\nspell. \\r\\n\\r\\nthey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick \\r\\ncalled they one by one into Professor Flitwick \\r\\n class to see if they \\r\\ncould make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. \\r\\nProfessor McGonagall watched they turn a mouse \\r\\ninto a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the \\r\\nsnuffbox was, but taken away if the \\r\\nsnuffbox had whiskers. \\r\\n“Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their \\r\\nnecks while their tried to remember how to make a \\r\\nForgetfulness potion. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 294 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry ever since Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry trip into the forest. \\r\\nNeville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves \\r\\nbecause Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that \\r\\nHarry kept being woken by Harry old nightmare, except \\r\\nthat it was now worse than ever because there was a \\r\\nhooded figure dripping blood in it. \\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harryhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have \\r\\nscars burning on they foreheads, but Harry and \\r\\nHermione didn’t seem as worried about The Sorcerer’s Stone as HarryHarry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared The idea of Voldemort, \\r\\nbut The idea of Voldemort didn’t keep visiting The idea of Voldemort in dreams, and The idea of Voldemort \\r\\nwere so busy with The idea of Voldemort studying The idea of Voldemort didn’t have \\r\\nmuch time to fret about what “Snape or anyone else \\r\\nmight be up to. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of Voldemort very last exam was History of Magic. One hour \\r\\nof answering questions about batty old wizards who’d \\r\\ninvented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free, \\r\\nfree for a whole wonderful week until they exam \\r\\nresults came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns \\r\\ntold they to put down they quills and roll up they \\r\\nparchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the \\r\\nrest. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said \\r\\nHermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto \\r\\nthe sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the \\r\\n1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of \\r\\nElfric the Eager.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione always liked to go through their exam \\r\\npapers afterward, but Harry said this made Harry feel ill, \\r\\nso they wandered down to the lake and flopped under \\r\\na tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 295 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ntickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was \\r\\nbasking in the warm shallows. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“No more studying,” Harry sighed happily, stretching \\r\\nout on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly \\r\\nwe’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was rubbing Harry forehead. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish I knew what this means\\\\” Harry burst out angrily. \\r\\n“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but \\r\\nnever as often as this.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning ... it \\r\\nmeans danger’s coming. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarryHarry, relax, Hermione ’s right, The unicorn’s dead safe as \\r\\nlong as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never \\r\\nhad any proof “Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. \\r\\n“Snape nearly had “Snape leg ripped off once, “Snape’s not going to \\r\\ntry it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch \\r\\nfor England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry nodded, but Harry couldn’t shake off a lurking \\r\\nfeeling that there was something Harry’d forgotten to do, \\r\\nsomething important. When Harry tried to explain this, \\r\\nHermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last \\r\\nnight and was halfway through my Transfiguration \\r\\nnotes before I remembered we’d done that one.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have \\r\\nanything to do with work, though. Harry watched an owl \\r\\nflutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a \\r\\nnote clamped in an owl \\r\\nflutter toward the school across the bright blue sky mouth. Hagrid was the only one \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 296 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwho ever sent Harry letters. Hagrid would never betray \\r\\nDumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to \\r\\nget past Fluffy . . . never . . . but — \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry suddenly jumped to Harry feet. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Where ’re you going?” said Harry sleepily. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. Harry had \\r\\nturned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, \\r\\nscrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagridwants more than anything else is a dragon, and a \\r\\nstranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in \\r\\na dragon pocket? How many people wander around with \\r\\ndragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they \\r\\nfound Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it \\r\\nbefore?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you talking about?” said Harry, but Harry, \\r\\nsprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t \\r\\nanswer. \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside Hagrid house; \\r\\nHagrid trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and Hagrid was \\r\\nshelling peas into a large bowl. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hullo,” Hagrid said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got \\r\\ntime fer a drink?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, please,” said Harry, but Harry cut Harry off. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you \\r\\nsomething. You know that night you won Norbert? \\r\\nWhat did the stranger you were playing cards with \\r\\nlook like?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 297 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dunno said Hagrid casually, “Hagrid wouldn’ take Hagrid \\r\\ncloak off.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid saw the three of them look stunned and raised Hagrid \\r\\neyebrows. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in \\r\\nthe Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the \\r\\nvillage. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ Mighta bin? I \\r\\nnever saw Mighta bin a dragon dealer face, Mighta bin a dragon dealer kept Mighta bin a dragon dealer hood up.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you talk to Harry about, Hagrid? Did you \\r\\nmention Hogwarts at all?” \\r\\n\\r\\nMighta bin a dragon dealer come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as Hagrid tried \\r\\nto remember. “Yeah ... Hagrid asked what I did, an’ I told \\r\\nHagrid I was gamekeeper here. ... Hagrid asked a bit about \\r\\nthe sorta creatures I look after ... so I told Hagrid ... an’ I \\r\\nsaid what I’d always really wanted was a dragon ... \\r\\nan’ then ... I can’ remember too well, ’cause ’cause kept \\r\\nbuyin’ me drinks. ... LetThe unicorn’s dead see ... yeah, then ’cause said ’cause \\r\\nhad the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I \\r\\nwanted . . . but ’cause had ter be sure I could handle it, ’cause \\r\\ndidn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told it ter, \\r\\nafter Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And did it ter — did it ter seem interested in Fluffy?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry asked, trying to keep it ter voice calm. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh \\r\\nmeet, even around Hogwarts? So I told it ter, Fluffy’s a \\r\\npiece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm yeh down, jus’ \\r\\nplay yeh a bit o’ music an’ yeh’ll go straight off ter \\r\\nsleep — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 298 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” yeh blurted out. “Forget I \\r\\nsaid it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, Harry, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other \\r\\nat all until Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to a halt in the entrance hall, \\r\\nwhich seemed very cold and gloomy after the \\r\\ngrounds. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagridtold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was \\r\\neither Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it \\r\\nmust’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just \\r\\nhope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us \\r\\nup if Bane doesn’t stop Bane. Where’s Dumbledore’s \\r\\noffice?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign \\r\\npointing They in the right direction. They had never \\r\\nbeen told where Dumbledore lived, nor did They know \\r\\nanyone who had been sent to see Dumbledore. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice \\r\\nsuddenly rang across the hall. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you three doing inside?” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of \\r\\nbooks. \\r\\n\\r\\n“us want to see Dumbledore,” said \\r\\nHermione, rather bravely, Harry and Harry thought. \\r\\n\\r\\n“See Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall \\r\\nrepeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to \\r\\nwant to do. “Why?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry swallowed — now what? \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 299 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he \\r\\nhadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils \\r\\nflared. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said \\r\\ncoldly. “Dumbledore received an urgent owl from the Ministry \\r\\nof Magic and flew off for London at once.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“DumbledoreThe unicorn’s dead gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, \\r\\nDumbledore has many demands on Dumbledore time — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But this is important.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Something you have to say is more important than \\r\\nthe Ministry of Magic, Potter?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \\r\\n“Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, Professor McGonagall \\r\\nwasn’t that. The books Professor McGonagall was carrying tumbled out \\r\\nof Professor McGonagall arms, but Professor McGonagall didn’t pick The books she was carrying up. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know — ?” Professor McGonagall spluttered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that \\r\\nsomeone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to \\r\\ntalk to Dumbledore.” \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall eyed Dumbledore with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall \\r\\nsaid finally. “I don’t know how you found out about \\r\\nthe Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal \\r\\nno one, no one’s too well protected.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But Professor — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 300 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” Professor McGonagall said \\r\\nshortly. Professor McGonagall bent down and gathered up the fallen \\r\\nbooks. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy \\r\\nthe sunshine.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut they didn’t. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once Harry was sure Professorwas out of earshot. “Snape’s going \\r\\nthrough the trapdoor tonight. Snape’s found out \\r\\neverything Snape’s needs, and now Snape’s got Dumbledoreout of the way. Dumbledore sent that note, I bet the Ministry \\r\\nof Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns \\r\\nup.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But what can we — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione gasped. Harry and Harry wheeled round. \\r\\nSnape was standing there. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good afternoon,” Snape said smoothly. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry and Ron stared at Snape. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” Snape said, \\r\\nwith an odd, twisted smile. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry and Ron were — ” Harry began, without any idea what Harry \\r\\nwas going to say. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging \\r\\naround like this, people will think you’re up to \\r\\nsomething. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose \\r\\nany more points, can Gryffindor?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snapecalled They back. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 301 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be warned, — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the \\r\\nvillage any more nighttime wanderings \\r\\nand I will personally make sure you are expelled. \\r\\n\\r\\nGood day to you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nyou strode off in the direction of the staffroom. \\r\\n\\r\\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” you whispered \\r\\nurgently. “One of we has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staffroom and follow Snape \\r\\n— if Snape \\r\\n— \\r\\nleaves the staffroom. Hermione, you’d better do that.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Why me?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s obvious,” said Harry. “You can pretend to be \\r\\nwaiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” Harry put on a \\r\\nhigh voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I \\r\\nthink I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but Hermione agreed to go \\r\\nand watch out for Snape. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” \\r\\nHarry told Harry. “Come on.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had \\r\\nthey reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest \\r\\nof the school than Professor McGonagall turned up \\r\\nagain and this time, Professor McGonagall lost Professor McGonagall temper. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a \\r\\npack of enchantments!” Professor McGonagall stormed. “Enough of this \\r\\nnonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here \\r\\nagain, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! \\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Weasley, from my own House!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room. Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 302 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and \\r\\nHermione came in. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry, Harry!” Professor McGonagall wailed. “Snape came out and \\r\\nasked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for \\r\\nFlitwick, and Snape went to get Snape, and I’ve only \\r\\njust got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other two stared at Snape. Snape was pale and Snape eyes \\r\\nwere glittering. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and \\r\\nget to the Stone first.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re mad!” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what Professor McGonagall \\r\\nand Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? \\r\\nIf Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming \\r\\nback! Haven’t you heard what it was like when Snape was \\r\\ntrying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to \\r\\nget expelled from! Snape’ll flatten it, or turn it into a \\r\\nschool for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter \\r\\nanymore, can’t you see? D’you think D’you’ll leave you \\r\\nand your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House \\r\\nCup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, \\r\\nI’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for \\r\\nVoldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later \\r\\nthan I would have, because I’m never going over to \\r\\nthe Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor \\r\\ntonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! \\r\\n\\r\\nVoldemort killed my parents, remember?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVoldemort glared at my parents. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 303 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just \\r\\nlucky I got It back.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But will it cover all three of us?” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“All — all three of us?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come off it, you don’t think us’d let you go \\r\\nalone?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you \\r\\nthink you’d get to the Stone the Stone without us? I’d better go \\r\\nand look through my books, there might be \\r\\nsomething useful. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But if us get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Professor Flitwicktold me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve \\r\\npercent on Professor Flitwick exam. I got a hundred and twelve \\r\\npercent on his exam’re not throwing me out \\r\\nafter that.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner the three of I got a hundred and twelve \\r\\npercent on his exam sat nervously apart in \\r\\nthe common room. Nobody bothered I got a hundred and twelve \\r\\npercent on his exam; none of \\r\\nthe Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any \\r\\nmore, after all. This was the first night Harry hadn’t been \\r\\nupset by This. Hermione was skimming through all her \\r\\nnotes, hoping to come across one of the \\r\\nenchantments they were about to try to break. Harryand Harry didn’t talk much. Harry \\r\\nand Ron Harry \\r\\nand Ron were \\r\\nthinking about what Harry \\r\\nand Ron were about to do. \\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly, the common room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Better get the cloak,” Harry muttered, as Lee Jordan \\r\\nfinally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran \\r\\nupstairs to their dark dormitory. Harry pulled out the \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 304 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncloak and then his eyes \\r\\n fell on the flute Hagrid had \\r\\ngiven Harry for Christmas. Harry pocketed the flute Hagrid to use on \\r\\nFluffy — Harry didn’t feel much like singing. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry ran back down to the common room. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We’d better put cloak on here, and make sure cloak \\r\\ncovers all three of We — if Filch spots one of We feet \\r\\nwandering along on its own — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of \\r\\nthe common room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, \\r\\nclutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though Neville’d \\r\\nbeen making another bid for freedom. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly \\r\\nputting cloak behind Harry back. \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville stared at their guilty faces. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re going out again,” Neville said. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, We’re not. Why don’t \\r\\nyou go to bed, Neville?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. \\r\\ntheir couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snapemight even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught \\r\\nagain. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is \\r\\nimportant.” \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Neville was clearly steeling Neville to do \\r\\nsomething desperate. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 305 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t let you do it,” Neville said, hurrying to stand in \\r\\nfront of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville,” Harry exploded, “get away from the portrait hole and \\r\\ndon’t be an idiot — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t \\r\\nthink you should be breaking any more rules! And \\r\\nyou were the one who told me to stand up to people!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but not to us,” said Harry in exasperation. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the \\r\\ntoad, who leapt out of sight. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising Neville \\r\\nfists. “I’m ready!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry turned to Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do something,” Neville said desperately. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione stepped forward. \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville,” Hermione said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” \\r\\nHermione raised Hermione wand. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Petrificus Totalusl” Hermione cried, pointing it at Neville. \\r\\n\\r\\nNeville’s arms snapped to Neville’s sides. Neville’s legs sprang \\r\\ntogether. Neville’s whole body rigid, Neville’s swayed where Neville’s \\r\\nstood and then fell flat on Neville’s face, stiff as a board. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione ran to turn Neville’s over. Neville’s jaws were \\r\\njammed together so Neville’s couldn’t speak. Only Neville’s eyes \\r\\nwere moving, looking at Only his eyes \\r\\n in horror. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 306 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’ve you done to Page | 306 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?” Harry whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. \\r\\n“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Harry as they \\r\\nstepped over Harry and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t \\r\\nfeel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, \\r\\nevery statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant \\r\\nbreath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on \\r\\ntheir. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the foot of the first set of stairs, their spotted Mrs. \\r\\nNorris skulking near the top. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, let’s kick Mrs. \\r\\nNorris, just this once,” Harry whispered in \\r\\nHarry’s ear, but Harry shook Harry head. As they \\r\\nclimbed carefully around Mrs. \\r\\nNorris, Mrs. \\r\\nNorris turned Mrs. \\r\\nNorris \\r\\nlamplike eyes on they, but didn’t do anything. \\r\\n\\r\\nthey didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the \\r\\nstaircase up to the floor. Peeves was bobbing \\r\\nhalfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would \\r\\ntrip. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s there?” Harry’s ear said suddenly as they climbed \\r\\ntoward Harry’s ear. Harry’s ear narrowed Harry’s ear wicked black eyes. \\r\\n“Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you \\r\\nghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s ear rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at \\r\\nthem. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping \\r\\naround unseen.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 307 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had a sudden idea. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Peeves,” Harry said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody \\r\\nBaron has Baron own reasons for being invisible.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. Baron caught \\r\\nBaron in time and hovered about a foot off the \\r\\nstairs. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” Baron said \\r\\ngreasily. “My mistake, My mistake — I didn’t see you \\r\\n— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old \\r\\nPeevsie Peevsie little joke, sir.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay \\r\\naway from this place tonight.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up \\r\\nin the air again. “Hope your business goes well, \\r\\n\\r\\nBaron, I’ll not bother you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Baron scooted off. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nA few seconds later, “Brilliant, Harry!” were there, outside the \\r\\nthird-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s \\r\\nalready got past Fluffy.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing the door somehow seemed to impress \\r\\nupon all three of “Brilliant, Harry!” what was facing “Brilliant, Harry!”. \\r\\nUnderneath cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \\r\\n\\r\\n“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” Harry said. \\r\\n“You can take cloak, I won’t need cloak now.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 308 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re coming,” said Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry pushed the door open. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their \\r\\nears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their \\r\\ndirection, even though it couldn’t see their. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s that at it feet?” Hermione whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Looks like a harp,” said Harry. “Snape must have left it \\r\\nthere.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said \\r\\nHarry. “Well, here goes ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nSnape put Hagrid’s flute to Snape lips and blew. It wasn’t \\r\\nreally a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes \\r\\nbegan to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the \\r\\ndog’s growls ceased — the \\r\\ndog’s growls tottered on the \\r\\ndog’s growls paws and fell \\r\\nto the \\r\\ndog’s growls knees, then the \\r\\ndog’s growls slumped to the ground, fast \\r\\nasleep. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep playing,” Harry warned Harry as they slipped out \\r\\nof cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. they \\r\\ncould feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they \\r\\napproached the giant heads. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Harry, \\r\\npeering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, \\r\\nHermione?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I don’t!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right.” Harry gritted Harry teeth and stepped carefully \\r\\nover the dog’s legs. Harry bent and pulled the ring of the \\r\\ntrapdoor, which swung up and open. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 309 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing \\r\\ndown, we’ll just have to drop.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Harry to \\r\\nget Harry attention and pointed at Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Harry. “I \\r\\ndon’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so Hermione can keep Hermione asleep.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ \\r\\nsilence, the dog growled and twitched, but the \\r\\nmoment Hermione began to play, the dog fell back into the dog \\r\\ndeep sleep. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry climbed over the dog and looked down through the \\r\\ntrapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry lowered Harry through the hole until Harry was \\r\\nhanging on by Harry fingertips. Then Harry looked up at Harry Harry and said, “If anything happens to Harry, don’t \\r\\nfollow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to \\r\\nDumbledore, right?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Right,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“See you in a minute, I hope. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past Harry as \\r\\nHarry fell down, down, down and — \\r\\n\\r\\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump Harry \\r\\nlanded on something soft. Harry sat up and felt around, \\r\\nHarry eyes not used to the gloom. his eyes felt as though Harry \\r\\nwas sitting on some sort of plant. \\r\\n\\r\\n“his eyes’s okay!” Harry called up to the light the size of a \\r\\npostage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “his eyes’s a \\r\\nsoft landing, you can jump!” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 310 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry followed right away. Harry landed, sprawled next to HarryHarry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s this stuff?” were Harry first words. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here \\r\\nto break the fall. Come on, Hermione!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark \\r\\nfrom the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. Hermione \\r\\nlanded on Harry’s other side. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We must be miles under the school,” Hermione said. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Lucky\\\\” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. Hermione \\r\\nhad to struggle because the moment Hermione had landed, \\r\\nthe plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils \\r\\naround Hermione ankles. As for Harry and Harry, Harry and Ron legs \\r\\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers \\r\\nwithout Harry and Ron noticing. \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione had managed to free Hermione before the plant got a firm grip on Hermione. Now Hermione watched in \\r\\nhorror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off \\r\\nthe two boys, but the more the two boys strained against the, the \\r\\ntighter and faster the plant wound around the two boys. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered the two boys. “I know what \\r\\nthis is — this’s Devil’s Snare!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s \\r\\ngreat help,” snarled Harry, leaning back, trying to stop \\r\\nthe plant from curling around Harry neck. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 311 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said \\r\\nHermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, \\r\\nwrestling with it as it curled around Harry chest. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare ... what did Professor \\r\\nSprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“So light a fire!” Harry choked. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermionecried, wringing Hermione hands. \\r\\n\\r\\n“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Harry bellowed. “ARE YOU A \\r\\nWITCH OR NOT?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and Hermione whipped out Hermione \\r\\nwand, waved her \\r\\nwand, muttered something, and sent a jet of \\r\\nthe same bluebell flames Hermione had used on Snape at \\r\\nthe plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it \\r\\nloosening it grip as it cringed away from the light \\r\\nand warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled it \\r\\nfrom Wriggling and flailing bodies, and Wriggling and flailing were able to pull free. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” \\r\\nsaid Harry as Harry joined Hermione by the wall, wiping sweat \\r\\noff Harry face. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “and Harry Harry doesn’t lose Harry \\r\\nhead in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone \\r\\npassageway, which was the only way forward. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll they could hear apart from they footsteps was the \\r\\ngentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The \\r\\npassageway sloped downward, and Harry was \\r\\nreminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 312 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nheart, Harry remembered the dragons said to be \\r\\nguarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If the dragons met a \\r\\ndragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad \\r\\nenough ... \\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you hear something?” Harry whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to \\r\\nbe coming from up ahead. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know ... sounds like wings to Harry.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe dragons reached the end of The \\r\\npassageway and saw \\r\\nbefore the dragons a brilliantly lit chamber, a brilliantly lit chamber ceiling \\r\\narching high above the dragons. a brilliantly lit chamber was full of small, jewel- \\r\\nbright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the \\r\\nroom. On the opposite side of a brilliantly lit chamber was a \\r\\nheavy wooden door. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you think the dragons’ll attack us if us cross the \\r\\nroom?” \\r\\nsaid Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Probably,” said Harry. “the dragons don’t look very vicious, \\r\\nbut I suppose if the dragons swooped down at once . . . \\r\\nwell, there’s no other choice ... I’ll run.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHe took a deep breath, covered He face with He arms, \\r\\nand sprinted across the \\r\\nroom. He expected to feel \\r\\nsharp beaks and claws tearing at He any second, \\r\\nbut nothing happened. He reached a \\r\\nheavy wooden door. He pulled the handle, but the handle was locked. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other two followed He. They tugged and heaved \\r\\nat a \\r\\nheavy wooden door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when \\r\\nHermione tried her Alohomora Charm. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 313 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now what?” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“These birds ... These birds ... can’t be here just for decoration,” \\r\\nsaid Hermione. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese birds ... watched These birds ... soaring overhead, glittering — \\r\\nglittering? \\r\\n\\r\\n“These birds ...’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “These birds ...’re \\r\\nkeys\\\\ Winged keys — look carefully. So that must \\r\\nmean ...” He looked around a brilliantly lit chamber while the \\r\\nother two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes — \\r\\nlook! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the \\r\\ndoor!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But there are hundreds of them!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry examined the lock on the \\r\\ndoor. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably \\r\\nsilver, like the handle.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the \\r\\nair, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They \\r\\ngrabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted \\r\\nand dived so quickly it was almost impossible to \\r\\ncatch one. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest \\r\\nSeeker in a century. Harry the youngest \\r\\nSeeker had a knack for spotting \\r\\nthings other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving \\r\\nabout through the whirl of rainbow feathers, Harry the youngest \\r\\nSeeker \\r\\nnoticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if he \\r\\n \\r\\nhad already been caught and stuffed roughly into the \\r\\nkeyhole. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That one!” Harry the youngest \\r\\nSeeker called to the others. “That big one — \\r\\nthere — no, there — with bright blue wings — the \\r\\nfeathers are all crumpled on one side.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 314 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry went speeding in the direction that Harry was \\r\\npointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off \\r\\nHarry broom. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve got to close in on his broom!” Harry called, not taking \\r\\nHarry eyes off a large silver key that had a bent wing with the damaged wing. “Harry, you \\r\\ncome at his broom from above Hermione, stay below and \\r\\nstop his broom from going down — and I’ll try and catch his broom. \\r\\nRight, NOW!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key \\r\\ndodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped \\r\\ntoward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a \\r\\nnasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone \\r\\nwith one hand. Harry and Hermione ’s cheers echoed \\r\\naround a brilliantly lit chamber. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon and Hermione ’s cheers landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the \\r\\nkey struggling in one hand. Harry rammed the door into the lock \\r\\nand turned — the door worked. The moment the lock \\r\\n had \\r\\nclicked open, the key took flight again, looking very \\r\\nbattered now that the door had been caught twice. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, Harry hand on the \\r\\ndoor handle. Ron and Hermione ’s cheers nodded. Harry pulled the door open. \\r\\n\\r\\na brilliantly lit chamber was so dark Ron and Hermione ’s cheers couldn’t see \\r\\nanything at all. But as Ron and Hermione ’s cheers stepped into a brilliantly lit chamber, light \\r\\nsuddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing \\r\\nsight. \\r\\n\\r\\nRon and Hermione ’s cheers were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, \\r\\nbehind the black chessmen, which were all taller than \\r\\nRon and Hermione ’s cheers were and carved from what looked like black \\r\\nstone. Facing Ron and Hermione ’s cheers, way across a brilliantly lit chamber, were \\r\\nthe white pieces. Harry, Harry and Hermione shivered \\r\\nslightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 315 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s obvious, isn’t It?” said Harry. “We’ve got to play We \\r\\nway across the room.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the white pieces the white pieces could see another door. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How?” said Hermione nervously. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think,” said Harry, “We’re going to have to be \\r\\nchessmen.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry walked up to a black knight and put Harry hand out \\r\\nto touch the knights horse. At once, black \\r\\nstone sprang \\r\\nto life. the knights horse pawed the ground and a black knightturned a black knight helmeted head to look down at Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do We — er — have to join you to get across?” \\r\\n\\r\\na black knight nodded. Harry turned to the other \\r\\ntwo. \\r\\n\\r\\n“This needs thinking about. ...” Harry said. “I suppose \\r\\nwe’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, Ron and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Harrythink. Finally Harry said, “Now, don’t be offended or \\r\\nanything, but neither of Harry are that good at chess — \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“we’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell we \\r\\nwhat to do.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and \\r\\nHermione, you go there instead of that castle.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What about you?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m going to be a knight,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 316 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because \\r\\nat these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned \\r\\na knight, a bishop, and a castle backs on the white pieces and walked off the \\r\\nboard, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Harry, \\r\\nand Hermione took. \\r\\n\\r\\n“White always plays first in chess,” said Harry, peering \\r\\nacross the \\r\\nboard. “Yes ... look ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry started to direct the white pieces. the white pieces moved \\r\\nsilently wherever Harry sent the white pieces. Harry’s knees were \\r\\ntrembling. What if the white pieces lost? \\r\\n\\r\\n— of course move diagonally four squares to the right.” \\r\\n\\r\\nthe white pieces first real shock came when the white pieces other knight \\r\\nwas taken. The white queen smashed their other knight \\r\\n to the floor \\r\\nand dragged their other knight \\r\\n off the board, where their other knight \\r\\n lay quite \\r\\nstill, facedown. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Had to let that happen,” said Harry, looking shaken. \\r\\n“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go \\r\\non.” \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white piecesshowed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp \\r\\nblack players slumped along the wall. Twice, Harry only \\r\\njust noticed in time that Harry, Ron and Hermione were in \\r\\ndanger. Harry darted around the \\r\\nboard, taking \\r\\nalmost as many white pieces as Harry, Ron and Hermione had lost black \\r\\nones. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re nearly there,” Harry muttered suddenly. “Let me \\r\\nthink — let me think ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe white queen turned The white queen blank face toward Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 317 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes ...” said Harry softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got \\r\\nto be taken.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“NO!” Harry, Ron and Hermione shouted. \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s chess!” snapped Harry. “You’ve got to make \\r\\nsome sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me — \\r\\nthat leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But — of course“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ron — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the \\r\\nStone!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no alternative. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ready?” Harry called, Harry face pale but determined. \\r\\n“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve \\r\\nwon.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stepped forward, and The white queen pounced. \\r\\nThe white queen struck Harry hard across the head with The white queen stone \\r\\narm, and Harry crashed to the floor \\r\\n — Hermionescreamed but stayed on The white queen square — The white queen dragged Harry to one side. Harry looked as if Harry’d \\r\\nbeen knocked out. \\r\\n\\r\\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe white king took off The white king crown and threw his crown at \\r\\nHarry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and \\r\\nbowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last \\r\\ndesperate look back at Harry, Harry and Hermionecharged through the door and up the next \\r\\npassageway. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 318 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What if Harry’s — ?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince \\r\\nHarry. “What do you reckonhe’s next?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; \\r\\nFlitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall \\r\\ntransfigured The chessmen to make them alive; that \\r\\nleaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nthem had reached another door. \\r\\n\\r\\n“All right?” Harry whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry pushed it open. \\r\\n\\r\\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of \\r\\nboth of \\r\\n pull both of \\r\\n robes up over both of \\r\\n noses. Eyes \\r\\nwatering, both of \\r\\n saw, flat on the floor \\r\\n in front of both of \\r\\n, a \\r\\ntroll even larger than the one both of \\r\\n had tackled, out \\r\\ncold with a bloody lump on the one they had tackled head. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I“ glad both of \\r\\n didn’t have to fight the one they had tackled,” Harrywhispered as they stepped carefully over one of its \\r\\nmassive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry pulled open another door, both of them hardly \\r\\ndaring to look at what came next — but there was \\r\\nnothing very frightening in here, just a table with \\r\\nseven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a \\r\\nline. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do both of \\r\\n have to do?” \\r\\n\\r\\nboth of them hardly \\r\\n stepped over the threshold, and immediately a \\r\\nfire sprang up behind both of them hardly \\r\\n in the doorway. It wasn’t \\r\\nordinary fire either; It was purple. At the same \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 319 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ninstant, black flames shot up in the doorway. black flames were trapped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to \\r\\nthe bottles. Harry looked over Harry shoulder to read her shoulder: \\r\\n\\r\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of us will help you, whichever you would find, \\r\\n\\r\\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead, \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead, \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo among us number hold only nettle wine, \\r\\n\\r\\nThree of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. \\r\\n\\r\\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, \\r\\n\\r\\nTo help you in your choice, us give you these clues \\r\\nfour: \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide \\r\\n\\r\\nYou will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; \\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end, \\r\\n\\r\\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend; \\r\\n\\r\\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size, \\r\\n\\r\\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in dwarf nor giant insides; \\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right \\r\\n\\r\\nAre twins once you taste twins, though different at first \\r\\nsight \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 320 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw \\r\\nthat Hermione was smiling, the very last thing he felt like \\r\\ndoing. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s \\r\\nlogic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t \\r\\ngot an ounce of logic, A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t \\r\\n’d be stuck in here forever.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But so will we, won’t we?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need \\r\\nis here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; \\r\\ntwo are wine; one will get we safely through the black \\r\\nfire, and one will get we back through the purple.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But how do we know which to drink?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me a minute.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione read this paper several times. Then Hermione \\r\\nwalked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to \\r\\nHermione and pointing at them. At last, Hermione clapped Hermione \\r\\nhands. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Got her \\r\\nhands,” Hermione said. “The smallest bottle will get The smallest bottlethrough the black fire — toward the \\r\\nStone.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry looked at The smallest bottle. \\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s only enough there for one of us,” Harry said. \\r\\n“That’s hardly one swallow.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked at each other. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Which one will get you back through the purple \\r\\nflames?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end \\r\\nof the line. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 321 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and \\r\\nget Harry. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, \\r\\nthey’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — \\r\\ngo straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to \\r\\nDumbledore, we need \\r\\nDumbledore. I might be able to hold \\r\\nSnape off for a while, but I’m no match for \\r\\nDumbledore, \\r\\nreally.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, \\r\\npointing at Harry scar. “I might get lucky again.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hermionel” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very \\r\\nembarrassed, as Hermione let go of Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There \\r\\nare more important things — friendship and bravery \\r\\nand — oh Harry — be carefull” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is \\r\\nwhich, aren’t you?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Positive,” said Hermione. Hermione took a long drink from \\r\\nthe round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously. \\r\\n\\r\\n“No — but It’s like ice.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Quick, go, before It wears off.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 322 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good luck — take care — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“GO!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione turned and walked straight through the \\r\\npurple fire. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest \\r\\nbottle. Harry turned to face the black flames. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Here I come,” Harry said, and Harry drained the smallest \\r\\nbottlein one gulp. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding Harry body. Harry \\r\\nput the smallest \\r\\nbottle down and walked forward; Harry braced \\r\\nHarry, saw the black flames licking his body, but \\r\\ncouldn’t feel the black flames — for a moment Harry could see \\r\\nnothing but dark fire — then Harry was on the other \\r\\nside, in the last chamber. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was already someone there — but it wasn’t \\r\\nSnape. It wasn’t even Voldemort. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 323 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Quirrell. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You\\\\” gasped Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell smiled. Quirrell face wasn’t twitching at all. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Me,” Quirrell said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be \\r\\nmeeting you here, Potter.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But I thought — Snape — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and Quirrell wasn’t Quirrell usual \\r\\nquivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, \\r\\nSeverus does seem the type, doesn’t Severus? So useful to \\r\\nhave Severus swooping around like an overgrown bat. \\r\\n\\r\\nNext to Severus, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- \\r\\nstuttering P-Professor Quirrell?Harry Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it \\r\\ncouldn’t. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But Snape tried to kill me!” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 324 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss \\r\\nGranger accidentally knocked me over as Your friend Miss \\r\\nGranger rushed \\r\\nto set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. Your friend Miss \\r\\nGranger \\r\\nbroke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds \\r\\nand I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed \\r\\nthat broom before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a \\r\\ncountercurse, trying to save you.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSnape Snape was trying to save me?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think \\r\\nSnape wanted to referee your next match? Snape was trying \\r\\nto make sure I didn’t do that broom again. Funny, really ... Snape \\r\\nneedn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with \\r\\nDumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought \\r\\nSnape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, Snape \\r\\ndid make Snape unpopular . . . and what a waste of \\r\\ntime, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.” \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin \\r\\nair and wrapped Ropes tightly around Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the \\r\\nschool on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d \\r\\nseen me coming to look at what was guarding the \\r\\nStone.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“ You let the troll in?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must \\r\\nhave seen what I did to the one in the chamber back \\r\\nthere? Unfortunately, while everyone else was \\r\\nrunning around looking for everyone else was \\r\\n, Snape, who already \\r\\nsuspected me, went straight to the third floor to head \\r\\nme off — and not only did the troll fail to beat you to \\r\\ndeath, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to \\r\\nbite Snape ’s leg off properly. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 325 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this \\r\\ninteresting mirror.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was \\r\\nstanding behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. \\r\\n\\r\\n“the Mirror of Erised is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrellmurmured, tapping Quirrell way around the frame. “Trust \\r\\nDumbledore to come up with something like this . . . \\r\\nbut Quirrell’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time Quirrell \\r\\ngets back. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry could think of doing was to keep Quirrelltalking and stop Quirrell from concentrating on the Mirror of Erised. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” Snape blurted out. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the Mirror of Erised to \\r\\nlook at the back. “Snape was on to me by that time, \\r\\ntrying to find out how far I’d got. Snape suspected me all \\r\\nalong. Tried to frighten me — as though Snape could, \\r\\nwhen I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell came back out from behind the Mirror of Erised and \\r\\nstared hungrily into the Mirror of Erised. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting the Stone to “Master ... \\r\\nbut where is the Stone?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding Harry, but \\r\\nthey didn’t give. Harry had to keep Quirrell from giving \\r\\nHarry whole attention to the Mirror of Erised. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Snape does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. \\r\\nSnape was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 326 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nknow? Page | 326 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n loathed each other. But Snape never wanted \\r\\nyou dead.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought \\r\\nSnape was threatening you. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across \\r\\nQuirrell’s face. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sometimes,” Snape said, “I find it hard to follow “Master’s instructions — Snape is a great wizard and I am \\r\\nweak — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean Snape was there in the classroom with you?” \\r\\nHarry gasped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Snape is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I \\r\\nmet Snape when I traveled around the world. A foolish \\r\\nyoung man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about \\r\\ngood and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong \\r\\nI was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, \\r\\nand those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have \\r\\nserved Lord Voldemort faithfully, although I have let Lord Voldemort down \\r\\nmany times. Lord Voldemort has had to be very hard on me.” \\r\\nQuirrell shivered suddenly. “Lord Voldemort does not forgive \\r\\nmistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from \\r\\nGringotts, Lord Voldemort was most displeased. Lord Voldemort punished me \\r\\n. . . decided Lord Voldemort would have to keep a closer watch on \\r\\nme. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering \\r\\nHarry trip to Diagon Alley — how could Harry have been so \\r\\nstupid? Harry’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken \\r\\nhands with Harry in the Leaky Cauldron. \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell cursed under Quirrell breath. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t understand ... is the Stone? \\r\\nShould I break the mirror?” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 327 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s mind was racing. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at \\r\\nthe moment, Harry thought, is to find the Stone before \\r\\nQuirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see \\r\\nmy self finding the mirror — which means I’ll see where the mirror’s \\r\\nhidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing \\r\\nwhat I’m up to? \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass \\r\\nwithout Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around Harry \\r\\nankles were too tight: Harry tripped and fell over. Quirrellignored Harry. Harry was still talking to Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What does the mirror do? How does the mirror work? Help \\r\\nme, “Master!” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice \\r\\nseemed to come from Quirrell. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Use the boy ... Use the boy ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell rounded on Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes — Potter — come here.” \\r\\n\\r\\n— Potter — clapped — Potter — hands once, and the ropes around his \\r\\nankles fell off. Harry got slowly to Harry feet. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror \\r\\nand tell me what you see.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry walked toward Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nI must lie, Harry thought desperately. I must look and lie \\r\\nabout what I see, that’s all. \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell moved close behind Harry. Harry breathed in \\r\\nthe funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 328 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nturban.

Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nturban. the reflection \\r\\nput the reflection hand into the reflection pocket and pulled out a blood- \\r\\nred stone. the reflection winked and put the Stone back in the Stone \\r\\npocket — and as the reflection did so, Harry felt something heavy \\r\\ndrop into its pocket. Somehow — incredibly — \\r\\nHarry’d gotten the Stone. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?” \\r\\nHarry screwed up Harry courage. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I see Harry shaking hands with Dumbledore,” Dumbledore \\r\\ninvented. “I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell cursed again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Get out of the way,” Dumbledore said. As Harry moved aside, \\r\\nDumbledore felt the Stone against Dumbledore leg. Dare Dumbledore \\r\\nmake a break for it? \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Dumbledore hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice \\r\\nspoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving Dumbledore lips. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dumbledore lies ... Dumbledore lies ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nPotter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me \\r\\nthe truth! What did you just see?” \\r\\n\\r\\na high voice \\r\\n spoke again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me speak to Dumbledore ... face-to-face. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Master, you are not strong enough!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I have strength enough ... for this. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 329 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting Devil’s Snare to the \\r\\nspot. Devil’s Snare couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, Devil’s Snare \\r\\nwatched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap \\r\\nDevil’s Snare turban. What was going on? his turban fell away. \\r\\nQuirrell’s head looked strangely small without his turban. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen Devil’s Snare turned slowly on the \\r\\nspot. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry would have screamed, but Harry couldn’t make a \\r\\nsound. Where there should have been a back to \\r\\nQuirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible \\r\\nface Harry had ever seen. face Harry was chalk white with \\r\\nglaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry Potter ...” face Harry whispered. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry tried to take a step backward but Harry legs \\r\\nwouldn’t move. \\r\\n\\r\\n“See what I have become?” a face, the most terrible \\r\\nface Harry had ever seen said. “Mere \\r\\nshadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can \\r\\nshare another’s body . . . but there have always been \\r\\nthose willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ... \\r\\nUnicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks \\r\\n. . . you saw Quirrell Quirrell drinking Quirrell for me in the \\r\\nforest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be \\r\\nable to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don’t \\r\\nyou give me that the Stone in your pocket?” \\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Stone knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into \\r\\nHarry’s legs. the Stone stumbled backward. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be a fool,” snarled a face, the most terrible \\r\\nface Harry had ever seen. “Better save your \\r\\nown life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as \\r\\nyour parents. ... \\r\\nyour parents died begging me for mercy. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 330 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell was walking backward at Harry, so that \\r\\nVoldemort could still see Harry. The evil face was now \\r\\nsmiling. \\r\\n\\r\\n“How touching ...” The evil face hissed. “I always value bravery. \\r\\n\\r\\n... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your father first, and your father put up a courageous fight . . . but \\r\\nyour mother needn’t have died ... your mother was trying to \\r\\nprotect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you \\r\\nwant your mother to have died in vain.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“NEVER!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Lord Voldemort \\r\\nscreamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harryfelt Quirrell’s hand close on Harry wrist. At once, a \\r\\nneedle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; Harry \\r\\nhead felt as though it was about to split in two; Harry \\r\\nyelled, struggling with all Harry might, and to Harry \\r\\nsurprise, Quirrell let go of Harry. The pain in Harry head \\r\\nlessened — Harry looked around wildly to see where \\r\\nQuirrell had gone, and saw Harry hunched in pain, \\r\\nlooking at Harry fingers — they were blistering before Harry \\r\\neyes. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Seize Harry! SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, \\r\\nand Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, \\r\\nlanding on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s \\r\\nneck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with \\r\\npain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony. \\r\\n\\r\\n““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my \\r\\nhands!” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground \\r\\nwith Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, \\r\\nbewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry \\r\\nlooked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 331 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then kill Harry, fool, and be done!” screeched \\r\\nLord Voldemort. \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell raised Quirrell hand to perform a deadly curse, \\r\\nbut Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed \\r\\nQuirrell’s face — \\r\\n\\r\\n“AAAARGH!” \\r\\n\\r\\nQuirrell rolled off Quirrell, Quirrell face blistering, too, and \\r\\nthen Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch Harry bare \\r\\nskin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only \\r\\nchance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep his in \\r\\nenough pain to stop his from doing a curse. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, \\r\\nand hung on as tight as Harry could. Quirrell screamed \\r\\nand tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s \\r\\nhead was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only \\r\\nhear Harry’s \\r\\n terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells \\r\\nof, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in \\r\\nHarry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from Harry grasp, knew \\r\\nall was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... \\r\\ndown ... \\r\\n\\r\\nSomething gold was glinting just above Harry. The \\r\\nSnitch! Harry tried to catch it, but Harry arms were too \\r\\nheavy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry blinked. It wasn’t The \\r\\nSnitch The \\r\\nSnitch at all. It was a pair of \\r\\nglasses. How strange. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry blinked again. The smiling face of Albus \\r\\nDumbledore swam into view above Albus \\r\\nDumbledore swam. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 332 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry stared at Harry Potter. Then 332 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry remembered: “Sir! the Stone! It was Quirrell! 332 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry’s got the Stone! Sir, quick — \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Calm yourself, Harry Potter, you are a little behind the \\r\\ntimes,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Then who does? Sir, I — ” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me \\r\\nthrown out.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry swallowed and looked around Harry. Harry realized \\r\\nHarry must be in the hospital wing. Harry was lying in a bed \\r\\nwith white linen sheets, and next to Harry was a table \\r\\npiled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said \\r\\nDumbledore, beaming. “What happened down in the \\r\\ndungeons between you and Quirrell is a \\r\\ncomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school \\r\\nknows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George \\r\\nWeasley were responsible for trying to send you a \\r\\ntoilet seat. No doubt your friends Misters Fred and George \\r\\nWeasley thought it would amuse \\r\\nyou. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be \\r\\nvery hygienic, and confiscated it.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“How long have I been in here?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger \\r\\nwill be most relieved you have come round, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger \\r\\n have \\r\\nbeen extremely worried.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But sir, the Stone — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Quirrell did not manage to take it \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 333 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although \\r\\nyou were doing very well on your own, I must say.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I \\r\\nreached London than it became clear to me that the \\r\\nplace I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived \\r\\njust in time to pull Quirrell off you — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It was you.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I feared I might be too late.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept Quirrell off the Stone much longer — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly \\r\\nkilled you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid \\r\\nNot the Stone, boy had. As for the Stone, Not the Stone, boy has been destroyed.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — \\r\\nNicolas Flamel — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, \\r\\nsounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing \\r\\nproperly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a \\r\\nlittle chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“But that means Nicolas and Nicolas wife will die, won’t he and his wife?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“he and his wife have enough Elixir stored to set he and his wife affairs in \\r\\norder and then, yes, he and his wife will die.” \\r\\n\\r\\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on \\r\\nHarry’s face. \\r\\n\\r\\n“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, \\r\\nbut to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 334 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well- \\r\\norganized mind, death is but the next great \\r\\nadventure. You know, the Stone the Stone was really not such a \\r\\nwonderful thing. As much money and life as you \\r\\ncould want! The two things most human beings would \\r\\nchoose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a \\r\\nknack of choosing precisely those things that are \\r\\nworst for humans.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed \\r\\na little and smiled at the ceiling. \\r\\n\\r\\nSir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if \\r\\nHarry’s \\r\\n gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Call Sir Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper \\r\\nname for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the \\r\\nthing itself.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Sir. Well, Harry’s \\r\\n going to try other ways of \\r\\ncoming back, isn’t Harry’s \\r\\n? I mean, Harry’s \\r\\n hasn’t gone, has \\r\\nHarry’s \\r\\n?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Harry, Harry’s \\r\\n has not. Harry’s \\r\\n is still out there \\r\\nsomewhere, perhaps looking for another body to \\r\\nshare ... not being truly alive, Harry’s \\r\\n cannot be killed. Harry’s \\r\\n \\r\\nleft Quirrell to die; Harry’s \\r\\n shows just as little mercy to Harry’s \\r\\n \\r\\nfollowers as Harry’s \\r\\n enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while \\r\\nyou may only have delayed Harry return to power, it will \\r\\nmerely take someone else who is prepared to fight \\r\\nwhat seems a losing battle next time — and if Harry is \\r\\ndelayed again, and again, why, Harry may never return \\r\\nto power.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made \\r\\nHarry head hurt. Then Harry said, Sir, there are some \\r\\nother things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ... \\r\\nthings I want to know the truth about. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 335 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“the truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and \\r\\nterrible thing, and should therefore be treated with \\r\\ngreat caution. However, I shall answer your questions \\r\\nunless I have a very good reason not to, in which case \\r\\nI beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well ... Lord Voldemort said that Lord Voldemort only killed my mother \\r\\nbecause my mother \\r\\n tried to stop Lord Voldemort from killing me. But \\r\\nwhy would Lord Voldemort want to kill me in the first place?” \\r\\n\\r\\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it \\r\\nfrom your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . . \\r\\nI know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, \\r\\nyou will know.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue. \\r\\n\\r\\n“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“my mother \\r\\n died to save you. If there is one thing \\r\\nLord Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. Lord Voldemort didn’t \\r\\nrealize that love as powerful as my mother \\r\\n’s for you \\r\\nleaves that love as powerful as your mother’s for you \\r\\n own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to \\r\\nhave been loved so deeply, even though the person \\r\\nwho loved us is gone, will give us some protection \\r\\nforever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, \\r\\ngreed, and ambition, sharing Quirrell soul with Lord Voldemort, \\r\\ncould not touch you for this reason. It was agony to \\r\\ntouch a person marked by something so good.” \\r\\n\\r\\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out \\r\\non the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry Harry \\r\\neyes on the sheet. When Harry had found Harry voice again, \\r\\nHarry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know \\r\\nwho sent his voice to me?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 336 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah — your father happened to leave his voice in my \\r\\npossession, and I thought you might like his voice.” \\r\\nDumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things ... Dumbledore used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens \\r\\nto steal food when Dumbledore was here.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“And there’s something else ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Fire away.” \\r\\n\\r\\nn’t Quirrell said Snape — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Professor Snape \\r\\n.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Quirrell said Quirrell hates me because Quirrell \\r\\nhated Dumbledore. Is that true?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Professor Snape \\r\\n did rather detest each other. Not unlike \\r\\nyourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, Dumbledore did \\r\\nsomething Snape could never forgive.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Snape saved Snape life.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way \\r\\npeopleHarry’s \\r\\n minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape \\r\\ncouldn’t bear being in DumbledoreHarry’s \\r\\n debt. ... I do \\r\\nbelieve Professor Snape \\r\\n worked so hard to protect you this year \\r\\nbecause Professor Snape \\r\\n felt that would make Professor Snape \\r\\n and your father \\r\\neven. Then Professor Snape \\r\\n could go back to hating Dumbledore’s \\r\\nmemory in peace. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry tried to understand this but this made Harry head \\r\\npound, so Harry stopped. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And Sir, there’s one more thing ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 337 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just the one?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did I get the Stone the Stone out of the mirror?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of \\r\\nmy more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, \\r\\nthatHarry’s \\r\\n saying something. You see, only one who \\r\\nwanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — \\r\\nwould be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see \\r\\nthey making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My \\r\\nbrain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough \\r\\nquestions. I suggest you make a start on these \\r\\nsweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was \\r\\nunfortunate enough in my youth to come across a \\r\\nvomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve \\r\\nrather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe \\r\\nwith a nice toffee, don’t you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nBertie Bott’s smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into the golden-brown beanmouth. Then Bertie Bott’s choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!” \\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but \\r\\nvery strict. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Absolutely not.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“You let Dumbledore Dumbledore in. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite \\r\\ndifferent. You need rest.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go \\r\\non, Madam Pomfrey ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, very well,” Madam Pomfrey said. “But five minutes only.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Madam Pomfrey let Ron and Hermione in. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 338 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Harryl” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nagain, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry \\r\\nhead was still very sore. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — \\r\\nDumbledore was so worried — ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“The whole school’s talking about The whole school’s,” said Ron. “What \\r\\nreally happened?” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story \\r\\nis even more strange and exciting than the wild \\r\\nrumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the \\r\\nmirror; the Stone; and Lord Voldemort. Ron and Hermionewere a very good audience; Ron and Hermione gasped in all the \\r\\nright places, and when Harry told Ron and Hermione what was \\r\\nunder Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So Harry’s \\r\\n gone?” said Ron finally. “Harry’s \\r\\n just \\r\\ngoing to die?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — \\r\\nwhat was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is \\r\\nbut the next great adventure.’ ” \\r\\n\\r\\n“I always said Dumbledore was off Dumbledore rocker,” said Ron and Hermionelooking quite impressed at how crazy Dumbledore hero was. \\r\\n\\r\\n“So what happened to Ron and Hermione two?” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought \\r\\nRon round — that took a while — and we were \\r\\ndashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when \\r\\nwe met Dumbledore in the entrance hall — Dumbledore already knew — \\r\\nDumbledore just said, ‘Harry’s \\r\\n gone after Harry, hasn’t Harry?’ and \\r\\nhurtled off to the third floor.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 339 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“D’you think “D’you meant you to do “D’you?” said Ron. \\r\\n“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if “D’you did — I mean to say \\r\\n— that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. ““D’you’s a funny \\r\\nman, Dumbledore. I think “D’you sort of wanted to give \\r\\nme a chance. I think “D’you knows more or less \\r\\neverything that goes on here, you know. I reckon “D’you \\r\\nhad a pretty good idea we were going to try, and \\r\\ninstead of stopping we, “D’you just taught we enough to \\r\\nhelp. I don’t think it was an accident “D’you let me find \\r\\nout how the mirror worked. the mirror’s almost like “D’you thought \\r\\nI had the right to face Lord Voldemort if I could. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off Dumbledore rocker, all right,” said \\r\\nRon. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end- \\r\\nof-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and \\r\\nSlytherin won, of course — you missed the last \\r\\nQuidditch match, we were steamrollered by \\r\\nRavenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” \\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” Madam Pomfrey \\r\\nsaid firmly. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n•k k k \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to \\r\\nnormal. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to go to the end- \\r\\nof-year feast,” Harry told Madam Pomfrey as \\r\\nMadam Pomfrey straightened Harry many candy boxes. “I can, can’t \\r\\nI?” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 340 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dumbledore Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to \\r\\ngo,” Madam Pomfrey said sniffily, as though in Madam Pomfrey opinion \\r\\nDumbledore Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts \\r\\ncould be. “And you have another visitor.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid sidled through the door as Dumbledore spoke. As usual \\r\\nwhen Dumbledore was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be \\r\\nallowed. Dumbledore sat down next to Harry, took one look at \\r\\nDumbledore, and burst into tears. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” Dumbledore sobbed, Dumbledore \\r\\nface in Dumbledore hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past \\r\\nFluffy! I told Dumbledore! It was the only thing Dumbledore didn’t \\r\\nknow, an’ I told Dumbledore! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a \\r\\ndragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked \\r\\nout an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking \\r\\nwith grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into \\r\\nYeh beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, \\r\\nthis is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, Yeh’d have found \\r\\nout even if you hadn’t told Yeh.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the \\r\\nname!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so \\r\\nshocked, Harry stopped crying. “I’ve met Harry and I’m \\r\\ncalling Harry by Harry name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we \\r\\nsaved the Stone, itHarry’s \\r\\n gone, Harry can’t use it. Have a \\r\\nChocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nHagrid wiped Hagrid nose on the back of Hagrid hand and \\r\\nsaid, “That reminds me. I’ve got Yeh a present.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is It?” said Harryanxiously, and at Hagrid Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 341 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter \\r\\nfix yesterday ter \\r\\n. ’Course, Dumbledore shoulda sacked me instead — \\r\\nanyway, got y eh this ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nthis seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. \\r\\nHarry opened this curiously. this was full of wizard \\r\\nphotographs. Smiling and waving at Harry from every \\r\\npage were Harry mother and father. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, \\r\\naskin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh \\r\\nlike it?” \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry made Harry way down to the end-of-year feast \\r\\nalone that night. Harry had been held up by Madam \\r\\nPomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving Harry one \\r\\nlast checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. the Great Hall \\r\\nwas decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and \\r\\nsilver to celebrate Madam \\r\\nPomfrey’s winning the House Cup \\r\\nfor the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing \\r\\nthe Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the \\r\\nHigh Table. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and \\r\\nthen everybody started talking loudly at once. Harry \\r\\nslipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the \\r\\nGryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that \\r\\npeople were standing up to look at Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The \\r\\nbabble died away. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. \\r\\n\\r\\n“And I must trouble you with an old manHarry’s \\r\\n wheezing \\r\\nwaffle before we sink we teeth into we delicious \\r\\nfeast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads \\r\\nare all a little fuller than your heads \\r\\n were . . . you have the \\r\\nPage | 342 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhole summer ahead to get them nice and empty \\r\\nbefore next year starts. ... \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs \\r\\nawarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, \\r\\nGryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in \\r\\nthird, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; \\r\\n\\r\\nRavenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and \\r\\nSlytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the \\r\\nSlytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging \\r\\nHarry goblet on the \\r\\nSlytherin table. It was a sickening sight. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. \\r\\n“However, recent events must be taken into account.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded \\r\\na little. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute \\r\\npoints to dish out. Let me see. Yes ... \\r\\n\\r\\n“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” \\r\\n\\r\\nRon went purple in the face; Ron looked like a radish \\r\\nwith a bad sunburn. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has \\r\\nseen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty \\r\\npoints.” \\r\\n\\r\\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; \\r\\nthe stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be \\r\\nheard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you \\r\\nknow! My brother! Got past McGonagall’s \\r\\ngiant chess set!” \\r\\n\\r\\nAt last there was silence again. \\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 343 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of \\r\\ncool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House \\r\\nfifty points.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly \\r\\nsuspected Hermione had burst into tears. Gryffindors up \\r\\nand down the table were beside Gryffindors up \\r\\nand down the table — Gryffindors up \\r\\nand down the table \\r\\nwere a hundred points up. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room went deadly quiet. \"... for pure nerve and \\r\\noutstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty \\r\\npoints.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while \\r\\nyelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now \\r\\nhad four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly \\r\\nthe same as Slytherin. Those who could add up while \\r\\nyelling themselves had tied for the House \\r\\nCup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one \\r\\nmore point. \\r\\n\\r\\nDumbledore raised Dumbledore hand. The room gradually fell \\r\\nsilent. \\r\\n\\r\\n“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, \\r\\nsmiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up \\r\\nto our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our \\r\\nfriends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville \\r\\nLongbottom.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well \\r\\nhave thought some sort of explosion had taken place, \\r\\nso loud was the noise that erupted from the \\r\\nGryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up \\r\\nto yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, \\r\\ndisappeared under a pile of people hugging Neville. Neville \\r\\nhad never won so much as a point for Gryffindor \\r\\nbefore. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs \\r\\nand pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more \\r\\nPage | 344 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nstunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind \\r\\nCurse put on Harry Potter. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of \\r\\napplause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were \\r\\ncelebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little \\r\\nchange of decoration.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHe clapped He . In an instant, the green \\r\\nhangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; \\r\\nthe huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering \\r\\nGryffindor lion took the huge Slytherin serpent place. Snape was shaking \\r\\nProfessor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced \\r\\nsmile. Snape caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once \\r\\nthat Snape ’s feelings toward Snape hadn’t changed one \\r\\njot. This didn’t worry Harry. This seemed as though life \\r\\nwould be back to normal next year, or as normal as it \\r\\never was at Hogwarts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than \\r\\nwinning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out \\r\\nmountain trolls ... Harry would never, ever forget tonight. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results \\r\\nwere still to come, but come the exam results \\r\\nwere still to come did. To the exam results \\r\\nwere still to come great \\r\\nsurprise, both Harry and Ron passed with good marks; \\r\\nHermione, of course, had the best grades of the first \\r\\nyears. Even Neville scraped through, Even Neville good \\r\\nHerbology mark making up for Even Neville abysmal Potions \\r\\none. both he and Ron had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as \\r\\nstupid as Even Neville was mean, might be thrown out, but Even Neville \\r\\nhad passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you \\r\\ncouldn’t have everything in life. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their \\r\\ntrunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking \\r\\nin a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all \\r\\nstudents, warning all \\r\\nstudents not to use magic over the \\r\\nholidays (“I always hope all \\r\\nstudents’ll forget to give us \\r\\nPage | 345 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthese,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to \\r\\ntake them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across \\r\\nthe lake; them were boarding the Hogwarts Express; \\r\\ntalking and laughing as the countryside became \\r\\ngreener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor \\r\\nBeans as them sped past Muggle towns; pulling off \\r\\nthem wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; \\r\\npulling into platform nine and three-quarters at \\r\\nKing’s Cross station. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the \\r\\nplatform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket \\r\\nbarrier, letting A wizened old guard go through the gate in twos and \\r\\nthrees so A wizened old guard didn’t attract attention by all bursting \\r\\nout of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, \\r\\n“both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look \\r\\nforward to.” \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople jostled People as People moved forward toward the \\r\\ngateway back to the Muggle world. Some of People \\r\\ncalled: \\r\\n\\r\\n“Bye, Harry!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“See you, Harry Potter!” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway \\r\\ntogether. \\r\\n\\r\\n“There He, Ron, and Hermione is, Mom, there He, Ron, and Hermione is, look!” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 346 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she \\r\\nwasn’t pointing at Ron. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see \\r\\n“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” \\r\\n\\r\\nFred Weasley smiled down at them. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Busy year?” she said. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the \\r\\nsweater, Mrs. Weasley.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it was nothing, dear.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Ready, are you?” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still \\r\\nmustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, \\r\\ncarrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary \\r\\npeople. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, \\r\\nlooking terrified at the very sight of Harry. \\r\\n\\r\\n“You must be Harry’s family!” said Fred Weasley. \\r\\n\\r\\n“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry \\r\\nup, boy, we haven’t got all day.” him walked away. \\r\\n\\r\\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and \\r\\nHermione. \\r\\n\\r\\n“See you over the summer, then.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said \\r\\nHermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, \\r\\nshocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPage | 347 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
