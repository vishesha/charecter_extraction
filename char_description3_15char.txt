Mr. Dursley
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although Mr. Dursley did have a very large mustache.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as Mr. Dursley spent so much of Mr. Dursley time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley put the receiver back down and stroked Mr. Dursley mustache, thinking ...
----------------------------------------------
For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what Mr. Dursleyhad seen — then Mr. Dursley jerked Mr. Dursley head around to look again.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley drummed Mr. Dursley fingers on the steering wheel and Mr. Dursley eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley crowd.” Mr. Dursley sipped Mr. Dursley tea through pursed lips.
----------------------------------------------
Mr. Dursley was sure the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning was the same one; the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning had the same markings around the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning eyes.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Dudley
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” Dudley’s passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry Dudley’s had never tasted anything so wonderful, but Dudley’s still couldn’t take His eyes off A giant of a man.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s face fell.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s stood with Dudley’s nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.
----------------------------------------------
a scrawny boy was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley’shit their.
----------------------------------------------
Next morning, however, Dudley’s had gotten up to find his hair exactly as his hair had been before His Aunt Petunia had sheared his hair off.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
Exactly why Dudley’s wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley’s was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody.
----------------------------------------------
“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let Dudley’s spoil your special day!” his mother cried, flinging his mother arms around Dudley’s.
----------------------------------------------
his money’s can’t take Atta boy, Dudley!”.” his money’s jerked his money’s head in Harry’s direction.
----------------------------------------------
Nobody said a thing while A giant of a man was working, but as A giant of a man slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley’sfidgeted a little.
----------------------------------------------
Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, Dudley’s said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” A giant of a man took a gulp of tea and wiped Dudley’s mouth with the back of Dudley’s hand.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley’s had punched Harry on the nose.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on Dudley’s thick, fat head.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s always sp- spoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with Dudley’s .
----------------------------------------------
“The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then Dudley’s ran, before Dudley’s could work out what Dudley’s’d said.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s’s mouth fell open in horror, but his money’s heart gave a leap.
----------------------------------------------
The lighted dial of Dudley’s’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the moth-eaten sofa on Dudley’s fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
In fact, Dudley’s wasn’t really crying — it had been years since Dudley’s’d really cried — but Dudley’s knew that if Dudley’s screwed up Dudley’s face and wailed, Dudley’s would give Dudley’s anything Dudley’s wanted.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking It as they watched a gorilla scratching It head who looked remarkably like Dudley’s, except that it wasn’t blond.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley’s won, so Harry, Harry glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on Harry stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
----------------------------------------------
Once, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair so short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had laughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was already laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit Dudley’s round the head for holding they up while Dudley’s tried to pack Dudley’s television, VCR, and computer in Dudley’s sports bag.
----------------------------------------------
When His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and Dudley arms over Aunt Petunia and Dudley faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
----------------------------------------------
’Atta boy, Dudley’s!” Atta boy, Dudley!” ruffled his money’s hair.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its beady eyes to the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s was hungry, Dudley’s’d missed five television programs Dudley’s’d wanted to see, and Dudley’s’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on Dudley’s computer.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s two less than last year.” “Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.” “All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley’s, going red in His face.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------
Dudley’s gave Dudley’s father a sharp tap on the head with Dudley’s Smelting stick.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Harry
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Each of a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of Harry — and they had an owl.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, “That’s — er ...” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
----------------------------------------------
You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment The blood of a unicorn touches your lips.” Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.
----------------------------------------------
There was somethin’ goin’ on that night Don hadn’t counted on — / dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped Don, all right.” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in Hagrid eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed the story, too?” Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell Harry without words that this wasn’t true, because Nevillewas looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if the largest snake in the place had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long.
----------------------------------------------
It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for wand when wand brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” Harry swallowed.
----------------------------------------------
The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.
----------------------------------------------
Fang rested Fang head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over Fang robes.
----------------------------------------------
Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
----------------------------------------------
yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran Hagridfingers through Yeh hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
“But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about — ” “ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth.
----------------------------------------------
“Take this.” He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
----------------------------------------------
Blood was pounding in Harry ears.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share ...
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and ’s going to be as long as your house.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Malkin’s stood Harry on a stool next to Madam Malkin’s, slipped a long robe over Madam Malkin’s head, and began to pin a long robe to the right length.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Then Hagrid voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry pulled the door open.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville’s robes’re in here somewhere,” Neville’s robes heard Harry mutter, “probably hiding.” “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, the others began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.
----------------------------------------------
the troll mean little eyes saw Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I want — ” Harry began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing three letters before Uncle Vernon eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, “Harry Potter?” Harry forced Harry to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
----------------------------------------------
How long Harry stood there, Harry didn’t know.
----------------------------------------------
Look down!” Harry looked down at Harry feet, but they were gone.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry astonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped Ropes tightly around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.
----------------------------------------------
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as Harry joined Hermione by the wall, wiping sweat off Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“We’ve got to close in on his broom!” Harry called, not taking Harry eyes off a large silver key that had a bent wing with the damaged wing.
----------------------------------------------
his eyes felt as though Harry was sitting on some sort of plant.
----------------------------------------------
Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” Harry’s ear rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell raised Quirrell hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — “AAAARGH!” Quirrell rolled off Quirrell, Quirrell face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch Harry bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep his in enough pain to stop his from doing a curse.
----------------------------------------------
They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled Harry back by the scruff of Harry neck.
----------------------------------------------
“You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” Harry was rubbing Harry forehead.
----------------------------------------------
At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; Harry head felt as though it was about to split in two; Harry yelled, struggling with all Harry might, and to Harry surprise, Quirrell let go of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
the troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up even a troll nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in Harry hand when Harry’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.
----------------------------------------------
“See what I have become?” a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen said.
----------------------------------------------
“Is it — dead?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.” Neville bent down and pulled his own wand out of the troll’s nose.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry still had a black mark on Harry nose.
----------------------------------------------
Harry put the smallest bottle down and walked forward; Harry braced Harry, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel the black flames — for a moment Harry could see nothing but dark fire — then Harry was on the other side, in the last chamber.
----------------------------------------------
“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing Harry sweaty hair out of Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where Harry had fallen and Harry mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah,” said Harry, “and Harry Harry doesn’t lose Harry head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley’s won, so Harry, Harry glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on Harry stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned to face the black flames.
----------------------------------------------
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed his mouthquickly.
----------------------------------------------
As They jostled They way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER!Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as Snape dropped his robes above his knees quickly to hide Snape leg.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t be a fool,” snarled a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
----------------------------------------------
And slowly, Harrylooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like Harry, other noses like Harry, even a little old man who looked as though Harry had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry Harry was looking at Harry family, for the first time in Harry life.
----------------------------------------------
Sure enough, Harry reflection looked back at Harry, just Harry head suspended in midair, Harry body completely invisible.
----------------------------------------------
The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
----------------------------------------------
The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but Pig won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “How’s your arm?” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s that?” said one of the red-haired twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s lightning scar.
----------------------------------------------
the people in the portraits along the corridors climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging the people in the portraits along the corridors feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther the people in the portraits along the corridors had to go when the people in the portraits along the corridors came to a sudden halt.
----------------------------------------------
“Everywhere else is full.” Harry shook Harry head and the youngest redheaded boy sat down.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got slowly to Harry feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch Neville eye).
----------------------------------------------
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only hear Harry’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
----------------------------------------------
The harder His Aunt Petunia tried to pull The over His Aunt Petunia head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had to clap his hands to Harry mouth to stop Harry from screaming.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
“Which is your wand arm?” “Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione stood up, Hermione crossed fingers in Hermione mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
----------------------------------------------
It might’ve been happening while we were there!” There was no doubt about It, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time.
----------------------------------------------
Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.
----------------------------------------------
Harrystuck his own wand up Harry nose and Neville knocked his own wand out with his own wand own club.
----------------------------------------------
“Let me think — let me think ...” The white queen turned The white queen blank face toward Harry.
----------------------------------------------
his money’s can’t take Atta boy, Dudley!”.” his money’s jerked his money’s head in Harry’s direction.
----------------------------------------------
Harry face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights.
----------------------------------------------
What if Harry just sat there with the hat over Harry eyes for ages, until Professor jerked it off Harry head and said there had obviously been a mistake and Harry’d better get back on the train?
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tore Harry eyes away from Harry motherFilch’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” “But that means Nicolas and Nicolas wife will die, won’t he and his wife?” “he and his wife have enough Elixir stored to set he and his wife affairs in order and then, yes, he and his wife will die.” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: Harry took a great running jump and managed to fasten Harry arms around the troll’s neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled back Harry bangs to show the lightning scar.
----------------------------------------------
A large black and silver volume caught Harry eye.
----------------------------------------------
A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and a pointed wizard’s hat began to sing: “Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat Harry if you can find A smarter hat than Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, that’s it — any questions?” Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
“And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
----------------------------------------------
The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled.
----------------------------------------------
““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, bewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harrysat down next to Ron, “I need to concern” Harry caught sight of Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but Harry kept them wide open.
----------------------------------------------
Although Harrycould tell it was daylight, Harry kept his eyes shut tight.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned Harry head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside they, the people doing they shopping.
----------------------------------------------
Harry got to Harry feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. “I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“his eyes’s okay!” Harry called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “his eyes’s a soft landing, you can jump!” Harry followed right away.
----------------------------------------------
“And that’s where ...” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.
----------------------------------------------
Harry kept Harry eyes fixed on the door.
----------------------------------------------
The lighted dial of Dudley’s’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the moth-eaten sofa on Dudley’s fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time.
----------------------------------------------
Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath.
----------------------------------------------
And what model is it?” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face.
----------------------------------------------
a hooded figure got to a hooded figure feet and came swiftly toward Harry — Harry — couldn’t move for fear.
----------------------------------------------
Hedwig sometimes flew in to nibble Harry ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls.
----------------------------------------------
“Who’s there?” Harry’s ear said suddenly as they climbed toward Harry’s ear.
----------------------------------------------
Once, His Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though Harry hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Harry hair so short Harry was almost bald except for Harry bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley’s had laughed Dudley’s silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where Dudley’s was already laughed at for Dudley’s baggy clothes and taped glasses.
----------------------------------------------
“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping him forehead.
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
what an honor.” Harry hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry Harry and seized Harry hand, tears in Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled his eye out with difficulty, because his eye was very heavy, and, balancing his eye on Harry knee, let his eye fall open.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through Harry, and Harryslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, One bookFilch’s shrieks still ringing in Harry ears.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned Harry sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed the door ajar and peered inside — and a horrible scene met Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
a hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down a hooded figure front.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
----------------------------------------------
“Hmm,” said a small voice in Harry ear.
----------------------------------------------
Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed Harry return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if Harry is delayed again, and again, why, Harry may never return to power.” Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made Harry head hurt.
----------------------------------------------
face Harry was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case his gets lonely.” From inside a large crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though his teddy was having his teddy head torn off.
----------------------------------------------
Up in the air, Snape turned on Snape broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past Snape, missing Snape by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, Harry arm raised in triumph, the Snitchclasped in the Snitch hand.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora\” the lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through the lock, shut the lock quickly, and pressed they ears against the lock, listening.
----------------------------------------------
Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, Harry kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Forgetting that Harry and Hermione were already invisible, Harry and Hermione shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“ Potter , did Anne” say?” “ “ Potter?” The last thing Harry saw before a pointed wizard’s hat dropped over Harry eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
...” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over Professor McGonagall glasses at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” Dudley’s passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry Dudley’s had never tasted anything so wonderful, but Dudley’s still couldn’t take His eyes off A giant of a man.
----------------------------------------------
” Harry leapt into the air; Harry’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\ Lights clicked on upstairs and to Harry horror Harryrealized that the big, squashy something had been Harry uncle’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw Harry clap Harry hand to Harry mouth as though was about to be sick — hit the field on all fours Higgs — coughed — and something gold fell into .
----------------------------------------------
Harry meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to Harry mouth, and what Harry said instead was, “Who are you?” A giant of a man chuckled.
----------------------------------------------
Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing we, Harry Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses askew.
----------------------------------------------
Just as Ronstarted moaning that Ron feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
A centaur was standing over Harry, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; Harry had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
----------------------------------------------
They made They way through the trees in silence for so long that Harrythought Firenze didn’t want to talk to Harry anymore.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s mouth went rather dry.
----------------------------------------------
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to catch it, but Harry arms were too heavy.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had had it as long as Harry could remember, and the first question Harry could ever remember asking His Aunt Petunia was how Harry had gotten it.
----------------------------------------------
I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into Yeh beard.
----------------------------------------------
Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with Harry head under Harry wing.
----------------------------------------------
Snape caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape ’s feelings toward Snape hadn’t changed one jot.
----------------------------------------------
Harry raised wand above Harry head, brought wand swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” Harry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
----------------------------------------------
a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skinlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
All right there, Harry?” Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry had found Harry voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent his voice to me?” “Ah — your father happened to leave his voice in my possession, and I thought you might like his voice.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s head was swimming.
----------------------------------------------
...” Yew shook Yew head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Harry!” Harry felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from Harry grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ...
----------------------------------------------
Harry wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley’s had punched Harry on the nose.
----------------------------------------------
Harry cheered up a bit when Harry found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.
----------------------------------------------
Harry could see Harry reflected in those misty eyes.
----------------------------------------------
The white queen struck Harry hard across the head with The white queen stone arm, and Harry crashed to the floor — Hermionescreamed but stayed on The white queen square — The white queen dragged Harry to one side.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
the knights horse pawed the ground and a black knightturned a black knight helmeted head to look down at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
I never saw Mighta bin a dragon dealer face, Mighta bin a dragon dealer kept Mighta bin a dragon dealer hood up.” Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.
----------------------------------------------
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along a hidden passageway and came out near they Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
----------------------------------------------
Then a pain like Harry —’d never felt before pierced Harry — head; it was as though Harry — scar were on fire.
----------------------------------------------
“Look — ” Harry murmured, holding out Harry arm to stop Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
but — Harry suddenly jumped to Harry feet.
----------------------------------------------
“Dudley’s always sp- spoils everything!” Dudley’s shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in Dudley’s mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said His Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with Dudley’s .
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s ear narrowed Harry’s ear wicked black eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until Harry was out of sight; Harry rose in Harry seat and pressed Harry nose against the window, but Harry blinked and Hagrid had gone.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
For some reason, the back of Harry neck prickled.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow Harry as quickly as possible; “Sniff around, my sweet scurried silently toward the door, away from the Fat Lady’s voice.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky mouth.
----------------------------------------------
Harry did the best Harry could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in Harry forehead, which had been bothering Harry ever since Harry trip into the forest.
----------------------------------------------
“I’d not say no ter summat stronger if got , mind.” Harry eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in His eyes and Harry snorted.
----------------------------------------------
It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking It as they watched a gorilla scratching It head who looked remarkably like Dudley’s, except that it wasn’t blond.
----------------------------------------------
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for Dumbledore, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at Harry scar.
----------------------------------------------
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all about Harry and Ron first lessons.
----------------------------------------------
Out of the corner of Harry eye Harry saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked carefully at Harry, astonishingly blue eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
----------------------------------------------
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
----------------------------------------------
My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.” My father turned back to Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harry scrambled to Harry feet, so happy Harry felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, let’s kick Mrs. Norris, just this once,” Harry whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
...” Harry tried to understand this but this made Harry head pound, so Harry stopped.
----------------------------------------------
The pain in Harry head lessened — Harry looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw Harry hunched in pain, looking at Harry fingers — they were blistering before Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Where’s Mommy?” “The baby dragon’s lost The baby dragon marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.
----------------------------------------------
It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.” Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry Harry eyes on the sheet.
----------------------------------------------
“I might get lucky again.” Hermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter ...” face Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
Harry leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second Harry was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in Harry ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — Harry stretched out Harry hand — a foot from the ground Harry caught a foot, just in time to pull his broom straight, and Harry toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in Harry fist.
----------------------------------------------
“Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” As the largest snake in the place shook the largest snake in the place head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of a deafening shout behind Harry jump.
----------------------------------------------
But Harry still didn’t open his eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry needed to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy to forget.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry sat up and felt around, Harry eyes not used to the gloom.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
— Marcus Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.” It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past Harry head, that it happened.
----------------------------------------------
Sometimes, when Harry strained Harry memory during long hours in Harry cupboard, Harry came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on Harry forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Harry mounted his broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up Harry soared; air rushed through Harry hair, and Harry robes whipped out behind Harry — and in a rush of fierce joy Harry realized Harry’d found something Harry could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
It was indeed as though ice was flooding Harry body.
----------------------------------------------
“That’s a broomstick,” That’s a broomstick said, throwing the package from Harry back to Harry Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
What’s that dog guarding?” Harry went to bed with Harry head buzzing with the same question.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled an Invisibility Cloak his head and Harry reflection vanished completely.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires.
----------------------------------------------
Potatoes, Harry?” Harry’s mouth fell open.
----------------------------------------------
“What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep Harry head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question.
----------------------------------------------
Exactly why Dudley’s wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley’s was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
“Want to go first, Hermione?” “No, I don’t!” “All right.” Harry gritted Harry teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
----------------------------------------------
Harry swung at Harry’s face with the bat to stop Harry’s face from breaking Harry nose, and sent Harry’s face zigzagging away into the air — Harry’s face zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of Harry’s face and managed to pin Harry’s face to the ground.
----------------------------------------------
Catching the look on Harry’s face, Harry added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull Hermione toward the door, but Hermione couldn’t move, Hermione was still flat against the wall, Hermione mouth open with terror.
----------------------------------------------
KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry!
----------------------------------------------
The only thing Harry liked about Harry own appearance was a very thin scar on Harry forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you,” Uncle Vernon had said, putting Uncle Vernon large purple face right up close to his money’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Harry had the best morning Harry’d had in a long time.
----------------------------------------------
the ghost in the ruff patted the ghost in the ruff arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling the ghost in the ruff ’d just plunged his arm into a bucket of ice-cold water.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron jumped to Harry and Ron feet.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given Harry for Christmas.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by Harry stunned face that Harry hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
----------------------------------------------
Harry nervously tried to flatten Harry hair.
----------------------------------------------
THE POTIONS MASTER “There, look.” “Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see Harry face?” “Did you see Harry scar?” Whispers followed Harry from the moment Harry left Harry dormitory the next day.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the portrait hole .
----------------------------------------------
Harry couldn’t make out the look on Harry face, but Harry was stuttering worse than ever.
----------------------------------------------
“Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.
----------------------------------------------
“Harryl” Hermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” again, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry head was still very sore.
----------------------------------------------
And I’d bet my broomstick Harry let that troll in, to make a diversion!” Hermione’s eyes were wide.
----------------------------------------------
“I know what this is — this’s Devil’s Snare!” “Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s great help,” snarled Harry, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around Harry neck.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was going to smash right into the barrier and then Harry’d be in trouble — leaning forward on Harry cart, Ron broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — Harry wouldn’t be able to stop — his cart was out of control — Ron was a foot away — Ron closed Ron eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come ...
----------------------------------------------
“Ready?” Harry called, Harry face pale but determined.
----------------------------------------------
“And have you really got — you know ...” Ron pointed at Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
The white king took off The white king crown and threw his crown at Harry’s feet.
----------------------------------------------
Harry came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in Harry class put together, but it made no difference, Harry hair simply grew that way — all over the place.
----------------------------------------------
a lamp looked as if a lamp was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel Harry arm supporting a lamp, the sight gave Harry the creeps.
----------------------------------------------
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at They, and Harry knew that the only reason They weren’t already dead was that They sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
the whole crowd was on the whole crowd feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of the whole crowd brooms, but it was no good — every time the whole crowd got near Ron, his broom would jump higher still.
----------------------------------------------
Meant ter turn Hagrid into a pig, but I suppose Hagrid was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” Hagrid cast a sideways look at Harry under Hagrid bushy eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad Harry fell to Harry knees.
----------------------------------------------
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to Harry feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and Ron muttered that Ron’d brought sandwiches.
----------------------------------------------
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous.
----------------------------------------------
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” Harry felt the blood drain out of Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
----------------------------------------------
Harry caught a glimpse of Harry face — and was startled to see that Harry was in tears.
----------------------------------------------
He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as Harry could remember, ever since Harry’d been a baby and Harry parents had died in that car crash.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.” Harry wished Harry had about eight more eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to Harry head.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was so close to the mirror now that Harry nose was nearly touching that of Harry reflection.
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
I bet Harry expected you to refuse, anyway.” “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” “Throw it away and punch ” on the nose,” Ronsuggested.
----------------------------------------------
As for Harry and Harry, Harry and Ron legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without Harry and Ron noticing.
----------------------------------------------
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to its feet.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Dumbledore
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore was beaming at the students, Albus Dumbledore arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased Albus Dumbledore more than to see them all there.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
Instead Albus Dumbledore was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat on the wall outside had had around the cat on the wall outside eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Dumbledore gave Professor Dumbledore wand a little flick, as if Professor Dumbledore was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of he was , which rose high above the tables and twisted he was , snakelike, into words.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah, music,” Professor Dumbledore said, wiping Professor Dumbledore eyes.
----------------------------------------------
When Harry had found Harry voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent his voice to me?” “Ah — your father happened to leave his voice in my possession, and I thought you might like his voice.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.
----------------------------------------------
And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
----------------------------------------------
“Hell have that scar forever.” “Couldn’t you do something about it, Albus Dumbledore?” “Even if I could, I wouldn’t.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry astonishment, that Albus Dumbledore ’s face had disappeared.
----------------------------------------------
Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” “But that means Nicolas and Nicolas wife will die, won’t he and his wife?” “he and his wife have enough Elixir stored to set he and his wife affairs in order and then, yes, he and his wife will die.” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that Lily and James Potter are —’re — dead.” Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to Albus Dumbledore feet.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycould go to Dumbledore at any moment.” Hagrid bit Hagrid lip.
----------------------------------------------
Twelve times Albus Dumbledore clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching Albus Dumbledore.
----------------------------------------------
But Dumbledore hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving Dumbledore lips.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” Dumbledore sobbed, Dumbledore face in Dumbledore hands.
----------------------------------------------
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for Dumbledore, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at Harry scar.
----------------------------------------------
HarryHarry, relax, Hermione ’s right, The unicorn’s dead safe as long as Dumbledore’s around.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above Albus Dumbledore swam.
----------------------------------------------
G ’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Wiping Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” streaming eyes on Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” jacket sleeve, Hagridswung Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar the engine rose into the air and off into the night.
----------------------------------------------
It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.” Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry Harry eyes on the sheet.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------

“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that Lily and James Potter are —’re — dead.” Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

Harry Potter
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
----------------------------------------------
Albus Dumbledore’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know every child in our world name!” “Exactly,” said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
----------------------------------------------
Everybody knew that Dudley’s’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in Dudley’s baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s’s gang.
----------------------------------------------
Harry Potter couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” THE VANASHIG GLASS Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
----------------------------------------------
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, “Harry Potter?” Harry forced Harry to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
“Harry Potter ...” face Harry whispered.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Hagrid
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid’s as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent they all heads and the little boats carried they all through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face.
----------------------------------------------
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, “That’s — er ...” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
----------------------------------------------
What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” “Dunno said Hagrid casually, “Hagrid wouldn’ take Hagrid cloak off.” Hagrid saw the three of them look stunned and raised Hagrid eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into Yeh beard.
----------------------------------------------
There was somethin’ goin’ on that night Don hadn’t counted on — / dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped Don, all right.” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in Hagrid eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.
----------------------------------------------
With Hagrid tongue between Hagrid teeth Hagrid scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry Harry letter.
----------------------------------------------
“our’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have Mr. Harry Potter’s key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and Hagrid started emptying Hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
----------------------------------------------
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told Two enormous feet that Hagrid was behind Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid and Harrymade for a long counter.
----------------------------------------------
yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran Hagridfingers through Yeh hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
----------------------------------------------
An old man was standing before them, Hagrid wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of The last shop.
----------------------------------------------
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided.
----------------------------------------------
“But I c-c- can’t stand Hagrid — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagallwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Albus Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
----------------------------------------------
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” Harry held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.
----------------------------------------------
It might’ve been happening while we were there!” There was no doubt about It, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give Hagrid two weeks and ’s going to be as long as your house.
----------------------------------------------
All right there, Harry?” Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
Then Hagrid voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as Harry pulled the door open.
----------------------------------------------
the unicorns had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
...” Yew shook Yew head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
— with a person called — came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew Hagrid nose with a sound like a foghorn.
----------------------------------------------
“Bin watchin’ from “Bin hut,” said Hagrid , patting a large pair of binoculars around Hagrid neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve decided to call The baby dragon Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at The baby dragon with misty eyes.
----------------------------------------------
You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw Snape!” “I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid ’s beard twitched and Hagrid ’s beard could tell Hagrid ’s beard was smiling.
----------------------------------------------
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid came back a minute later with a pile of books in Hagrid arms and slammed them down on the table.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from Hagrid face — Hagrid leapt to Hagrid feet and ran to the window.
----------------------------------------------
They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled Harry back by the scruff of Harry neck.
----------------------------------------------
Harry pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given Harry for Christmas.
----------------------------------------------
After a few minutes It’s stammered, “What does it mean, they await your owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to Hagrid forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside Hagrid overcoat Hagrid pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
----------------------------------------------
Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until Harry was out of sight; Harry rose in Harry seat and pressed Harry nose against the window, but Harry blinked and Hagrid had gone.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
----------------------------------------------
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking Ron ears.
----------------------------------------------
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying sir face in Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycould go to Dumbledore at any moment.” Hagrid bit Hagrid lip.
----------------------------------------------
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling Hagrid feet.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid relief must have showed in Hagrid face, because Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?
----------------------------------------------
Ron was cursing your broomstick, muttering, Ron wouldn’t take his eyes off Ron.” “Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to Ron in the stands.
----------------------------------------------
I will take Hagrid’s from here.” A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes pulled front door wide.
----------------------------------------------
Behind the wild beard and eyebrows Hagrid wore a very kind smile.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
At the end nearest the ghost in the ruff sat Hagrid, who caught the ghost in the ruff eye and gave the ghost in the ruff the thumbs up.
----------------------------------------------
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all about Harry and Ron first lessons.
----------------------------------------------
Meant ter turn Hagrid into a pig, but I suppose Hagrid was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” Hagrid cast a sideways look at Harry under Hagrid bushy eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking Ron head through the branches.
----------------------------------------------
For a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Albus Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
----------------------------------------------
...” Hagrid wiped Hagrid nose on the back of Hagrid hand and said, “That reminds me.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, here goes ...” Snape put Hagrid’s flute to Snape lips and blew.
----------------------------------------------
his anger faded from Hagrid face.
----------------------------------------------
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.” Harry wished Harry had about eight more eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked Hagrid beard.
----------------------------------------------
Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, Harry kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry?
----------------------------------------------
Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Albus Dumbledore took Harry in Albus Dumbledore arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid seized Hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over Hogwarts head, “Hogwarts — ” Hogwarts thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Dudley hands clasped over Dudley fat bottom, howling in pain.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Uncle Vernon
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place could have wrapped the largest snake in the place body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed its body into a trash can — but at the moment its body didn’t look in the mood.
----------------------------------------------
“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of Uncle Vernon mustache at the same time.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley’s to the ground to get the letter from Uncle Vernon, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
----------------------------------------------
No arguments!” Uncle Vernon looked so dangerous with half Uncle Vernon mustache missing that no one dared argue.
----------------------------------------------
When His Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s had run out with Aunt Petunia and Dudley arms over Aunt Petunia and Dudley faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer His Aunt Petunia when His Aunt Petunia asked what Uncle Vernon’d bought.
----------------------------------------------
An’ An’’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” “we swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him!
----------------------------------------------
“Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
----------------------------------------------
“I want — ” Harry began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing three letters before Uncle Vernon eyes.
----------------------------------------------
the largest snake in the place jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its beady eyes to the ceiling.
----------------------------------------------
“I’m warning you,” Uncle Vernon had said, putting Uncle Vernon large purple face right up close to his money’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe Uncle Vernon.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook Uncle Vernon head, got back in the car, and off them went again.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon seat and yelled at Harry, Uncle Vernon face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
----------------------------------------------
“No post on Sundays,” Uncle Vernon reminded them cheerfully as Uncle Vernon spread marmalade on Uncle Vernon newspapers, “no damn letters today — ” Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as Something spoke and caught Something sharply on the back of the head.
----------------------------------------------
“Comb your hair!” Uncle Vernon barked, by way of a morning greeting.
----------------------------------------------
Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon was holding a rifle in Uncle Vernon hands — now they knew what had been in the long, thin package Uncle Vernon had brought with they.
----------------------------------------------
Uncle Vernon won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Quirrell
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skinlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell face wasn’t twitching at all.
----------------------------------------------
SEIZE Harry!” shrieked Lord Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of Harry, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding Harry with pain, yet Harry could see Quirrell howling in agony.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without his turban.
----------------------------------------------
At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; Harry head felt as though it was about to split in two; Harry yelled, struggling with all Harry might, and to Harry surprise, Quirrell let go of Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell raised Quirrell hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — “AAAARGH!” Quirrell rolled off Quirrell, Quirrell face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch Harry bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep his in enough pain to stop his from doing a curse.
----------------------------------------------
““Master, I cannot hold Harry — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with Harry knees, let go of Harry neck and stared, bewildered, at Harry own palms Harry Harry could see Harry looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry!” Harry felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from Harry grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ...
----------------------------------------------
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened Hermione mouth, perhaps to tell Ronexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harryhissed at Hermione to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
----------------------------------------------
The pain in Harry head lessened — Harry looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw Harry hunched in pain, looking at Harry fingers — they were blistering before Harry eyes.
----------------------------------------------
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as Harry could.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Quirrell, in Professor Quirrell absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
----------------------------------------------
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — Harry couldn’t see — Harry could only hear Harry’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
----------------------------------------------
But Dumbledore hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving Dumbledore lips.
----------------------------------------------
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Percy
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink.
----------------------------------------------
Get “P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing we, Harry Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses askew.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Now Percy’s a prefect old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside Ron jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.
----------------------------------------------
“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and a portrait of a very fat woman swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.
----------------------------------------------
Percy nearly broke Percy teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in Percy slice.
----------------------------------------------
“Merry Christmas is a time for family.” They frog-marched Percy from the room, They frog-marched Percy from the room arms pinned to They frog-marched Percy from the room side by They frog-marched Percy from the room .
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Ron
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with Harry beard, “That’s — er ...” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
----------------------------------------------
“Quick!” Ron threw an Invisibility Cloak back over their as his eyes came round the door.
----------------------------------------------
Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink.
----------------------------------------------
Just as Ronstarted moaning that Ron feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
----------------------------------------------
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
He’d be able to read as long as Ron liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” Ron waved a very battered-looking wand, but nothing happened.
----------------------------------------------
Ron’s was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
----------------------------------------------
Ouch!” Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head.
----------------------------------------------
“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” Ron went purple in the face; Ron looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
“Say that again,” Ron said, Ron face as red as Ron hair.
----------------------------------------------
“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?” Ron glared at her as her left.
----------------------------------------------
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind his, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was almost as tall as the red-haired twins already and Ron nose was still pink where Their mother had rubbed his nose.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron jumped to Harry and Ron feet.
----------------------------------------------
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore Ron away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Ronwas more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harrycouldn’t keep Ron’s eyes off the Famous Witches.
----------------------------------------------
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by Harry stunned face that Harry hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
“And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing Ron eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of Ron wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but The youngest boy grabbed The youngest boy and began rubbing the end of The youngest boy nose.
----------------------------------------------
I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Now Percy’s a prefect old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside Ron jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.
----------------------------------------------
“Charlie’s in Romania were a bit short for Ron, you could see Ron sneakers underneath Ron, .
----------------------------------------------
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking Ron ears.
----------------------------------------------
You can start collecting.” Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.
----------------------------------------------
Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to Ron mouth, but Ron’d forgotten all about a piece of steak.
----------------------------------------------
“the Fat Lady’s, maybe Harry’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harrysat down next to Ron, “I need to concern” Harry caught sight of Harry’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. “I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
Harry was going to smash right into the barrier and then Harry’d be in trouble — leaning forward on Harry cart, Ron broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — Harry wouldn’t be able to stop — his cart was out of control — Ron was a foot away — Ron closed Ron eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come ...
----------------------------------------------
“And have you really got — you know ...” Ron pointed at Harry’s forehead.
----------------------------------------------
Ron was cursing your broomstick, muttering, Ron wouldn’t take his eyes off Ron.” “Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to Ron in the stands.
----------------------------------------------
There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.” Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes teeth, but Harry and Ronpretended to be enjoying The rock cakes as The rock cakes told Hagrid all about Harry and Ron first lessons.
----------------------------------------------
the whole crowd was on the whole crowd feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of the whole crowd brooms, but it was no good — every time the whole crowd got near Ron, his broom would jump higher still.
----------------------------------------------
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking Ron head through the branches.
----------------------------------------------
“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
----------------------------------------------
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to Harry feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and Ron muttered that Ron’d brought sandwiches.
----------------------------------------------
As They jostled They way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
----------------------------------------------
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous.
----------------------------------------------
Ron opened his eyes.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.” “I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as Ron pulled it over Ron head.
----------------------------------------------
What He, Ron, and Hermione really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down He, Ron, and Hermione necks.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” When Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky letter, Norbert eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg.
----------------------------------------------
Ron finally tore Ron’s eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.
----------------------------------------------
Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Ron stared after Hermione, Ron mouth open.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
----------------------------------------------
“So,” said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “it — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
----------------------------------------------
Where’s Mommy?” “The baby dragon’s lost The baby dragon marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.
----------------------------------------------
As for Harry and Harry, Harry and Ron legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without Harry and Ron noticing.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
it’ll really wipe the smiles off Ron and Hermione faces if we win.” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Neville
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
In stinking Slytherin.” Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as Slytherin unwrapped the frog.
----------------------------------------------
I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed the story, too?” Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell Harry without words that this wasn’t true, because Nevillewas looking stunned and hurt.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s whole body rigid, Neville’s swayed where Neville’s stood and then fell flat on Neville’s face, stiff as a board.
----------------------------------------------
Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch Neville eye).
----------------------------------------------
Harrystuck his own wand up Harry nose and Neville knocked his own wand out with his own wand own club.
----------------------------------------------
“it’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.” “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Neville snarled.
----------------------------------------------
“Neville’s robes’re in here somewhere,” Neville’s robes heard Harry mutter, “probably hiding.” “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, the others began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
On my whistle — three — two — ” But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.
----------------------------------------------
“And I gave ” Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had sunk to the third floor in fright; Neville pulled out Neville own wand — not knowing what Neville was going to do Neville heard Neville cry the first spell that came into Neville head: “Wingardium Leviosal” its club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s head.
----------------------------------------------
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around his.
----------------------------------------------
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along a hidden passageway and came out near they Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
Only Neville’s eyes were moving, looking at Only his eyes in horror.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s arms snapped to Neville’s sides.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
“Is it — dead?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.” Neville bent down and pulled his own wand out of the troll’s nose.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady’s robes had barely whipped round a corner when Neville’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
“Report Neville!” Neville shook Neville head.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve just thought Hermione.” “What about Hermione?” “Hermione doesn’t know about the troll.” Neville bit Neville lip.
----------------------------------------------
Neville’s legs sprang apart and Neville’s got to Neville’s feet, trembling.
----------------------------------------------
I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.” Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under Neville’s left ear, and on “Charlie’s in Romaniasmudged nose.
----------------------------------------------
Peeves stuck out Peeves tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Hermione
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” Hermione had managed to get to his feet at last.
----------------------------------------------
“I think Hermionedoes, though, why don’t you try Hermione?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
----------------------------------------------
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press Ron, and Hermione ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
----------------------------------------------
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” Hermione snapped.
----------------------------------------------
What if you knock something over?” “You sound like Hermione.” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened Hermione mouth, perhaps to tell Ronexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harryhissed at Hermione to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
Harry walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Harry head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Harry onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
----------------------------------------------
Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione stood up, Hermione crossed fingers in Hermione mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of Hermione gown, flicked his wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ “Wingardium LeviosaV rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above “Wingardium LeviosaV heads.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had stopped drawing attention to Hermione in class, keeping Hermione head down and working in silence.
----------------------------------------------
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville , we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville , scrambling to Neville feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Fat Lady’sbeen past twice already.” Ron looked at Ron watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
----------------------------------------------
“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull Hermione toward the door, but Hermione couldn’t move, Hermione was still flat against the wall, Hermione mouth open with terror.
----------------------------------------------
the troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.
----------------------------------------------
the unicorns had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm.
----------------------------------------------
“Want to go first, Hermione?” “No, I don’t!” “All right.” Harry gritted Harry teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had sunk to the third floor in fright; Neville pulled out Neville own wand — not knowing what Neville was going to do Neville heard Neville cry the first spell that came into Neville head: “Wingardium Leviosal” its club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s head.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.
----------------------------------------------
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as Harry joined Hermione by the wall, wiping sweat off Harry face.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from Hagrid face — Hagrid leapt to Hagrid feet and ran to the window.
----------------------------------------------
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of Harry and Ron, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
not the floorthe Fat Lady’sobviously guarding something.” Hermione stood up, glaring at them.
----------------------------------------------
“Granger, Hermione!” Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed a pointed wizard’s hateagerly on Hermione head.
----------------------------------------------
“Harryl” Hermione looked ready to fling Madam Pomfrey arms around Harryl” again, but Harry was glad Madam Pomfrey held Madam Pomfrey in as Harry head was still very sore.
----------------------------------------------
And I’d bet my broomstick Harry let that troll in, to make a diversion!” Hermione’s eyes were wide.
----------------------------------------------
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before Hermione was dashing back, an enormous old book in Hermione arms. “I never thought to look in here!” Hermione whispered excitedly.
----------------------------------------------
“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably.
----------------------------------------------
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.” Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all Hermione notes.
----------------------------------------------
“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.
----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
HarryHarry, relax, Hermione ’s right, The unicorn’s dead safe as long as Dumbledore’s around.
----------------------------------------------
“What’s that at it feet?” Hermione whispered.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ve just thought Hermione.” “What about Hermione?” “Hermione doesn’t know about the troll.” Neville bit Neville lip.
----------------------------------------------
What He, Ron, and Hermione really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down He, Ron, and Hermione necks.
----------------------------------------------
“Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” When Ron, and Hermione told Norbert about Norbert’s at a tricky letter, Norbert eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten Norbert on the leg.
----------------------------------------------
Look — read that, there.” Hermione pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
----------------------------------------------
Hermionehad turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady the Fat Lady to get back inside and found Hermione facing an empty painting.
----------------------------------------------
Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Ron stared after Hermione, Ron mouth open.
----------------------------------------------
“I might get lucky again.” Hermione’s lip trembled, and Hermione suddenly dashed at Harry Harry and threw Hermione arms around Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Forgetting that Harry and Hermione were already invisible, Harry and Hermione shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.
----------------------------------------------
it’ll really wipe the smiles off Ron and Hermione faces if we win.” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Gryffindor
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried Hermione face in Hermione arms; Harry strongly suspected Hermione had burst into tears.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Binns was head of Gryffindor House, but Professor Binns hadn’t stopped Professor Binns from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened Harry mouth to argue, but Ron kicked Harry behind argue cauldron.
----------------------------------------------
— Marcus Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.” It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past Harry head, that it happened.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
----------------------------------------------
“And that girl’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Chaser Angelina Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Flint gains the Quaffle and off Chaser Angelina Johnson goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — Chaser Angelina Johnson’s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but ’s Adrian Pucey blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Chaser Angelina Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Malfoy
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy was only a few feet away and Malfoy had stopped dead to listen.
----------------------------------------------
HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn’t believe HALLOWEEN Malfoy eyes when HALLOWEEN Malfoy saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoycomplained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with Malfoy narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.
----------------------------------------------
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and Professor McGonagall glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t Professor McGonagall fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Parvati Patil — ” “But Malfoy — ” “That’s enough, George Weasley.
----------------------------------------------
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.
----------------------------------------------
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying Malfoy was going to catch you, Malfoy said you had a drag — ” Harry shook Malfoy head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had seen.
----------------------------------------------
On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face.
----------------------------------------------
“And I gave ” Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
----------------------------------------------
There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.” “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.
----------------------------------------------
“Look — ” Harry murmured, holding out Harry arm to stop Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
See, there’s Potter, whoFilch’s got no parents, then thereFilch’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the Gryffindor team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face Malfoy.
----------------------------------------------
And what model is it?” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, “You tell Ron, Neville.” Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and thatFilch’s saying something.” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
Scabbers the rat was hanging off Scabbers finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbersround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of — Crabbe and Malfoy disappeared at once.
----------------------------------------------
Harry turned Harry sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
----------------------------------------------
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
----------------------------------------------
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermionevery nervous.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
----------------------------------------------
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if Harry Potter’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on Harry Potter.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy and Crabbe edged along the walls, keeping Malfoy and Crabbe eyes on the doors at either end of the room.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Snape
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
“I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” Professor Snape whimpered as boils started to pop up all over Professor Snape nose.
----------------------------------------------
Privately, Harry felt Harry’d had good reason, because Professor Snape managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Gryffindors saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
----------------------------------------------
Harry tried to empty Harry mind — Harry needed to sleep, Harry had to, Harry had Harry first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen Harry leg wasn’t easy to forget.
----------------------------------------------
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House.
----------------------------------------------
Snape was pale and Snape eyes were glittering.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape swept around in Professor Snape long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom Professor Snape seemed to like.
----------------------------------------------
“Well have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.” Snape threw Snape cloak over Snape head and strode out of a shadowy clearing.
----------------------------------------------
“One of we has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staffroom and follow Snape — if Snape — leaves the staffroom.
----------------------------------------------
Snape caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape ’s feelings toward Snape hadn’t changed one jot.
----------------------------------------------
Harry saw Harry scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw Harry gasp, slip sideways off his broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Professor Snape lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
----------------------------------------------
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.
----------------------------------------------
Look, you hold it tight like this and if this turns red — oh ...” Professor Snape face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “...
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape eyes were black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s warmth.
----------------------------------------------
They say Snape’s Head of Slytherin House always favors They — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Professor Binns favored us,” said Harry.
----------------------------------------------
Harryhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
----------------------------------------------
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in their potionwhen Seamus’s cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, something about Harry, Ron, and Hermione guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
----------------------------------------------
You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw Snape!” “I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly.
----------------------------------------------
Snape’s asked if Snape’s knew how to get past Fluffy — and Snape’s said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ” “So you mean ’s only safe as long as Quirrellstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
----------------------------------------------
Professor Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer.
----------------------------------------------
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted, but Professor Snape was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
----------------------------------------------
Madam Hooch was bending over Professor Snape, Madam Hooch face as white as Madam Hooch.
----------------------------------------------
Snape had Snape eyes fixed on Harry Harry and was muttering nonstop under Snape breath.
----------------------------------------------
“I’ll get Crabbe,” said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get Crabbe — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
----------------------------------------------
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for Dumbledore, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with Harry?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at Harry scar.
----------------------------------------------
“If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape.
----------------------------------------------
“Wonder how long Snape’s going to stay on Snape’s broom this time?
----------------------------------------------
“Ron was provoked, Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
----------------------------------------------
“Well, here goes ...” Snape put Hagrid’s flute to Snape lips and blew.
----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for everyone else was , Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did the troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape ’s leg off properly.
----------------------------------------------
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Professor Snape’s voice that said only too clearly that Harry wanted to keep Harry feet on the ground.
----------------------------------------------
“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER!Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as Snape dropped his robes above his knees quickly to hide Snape leg.
----------------------------------------------
Up in the air, Snape turned on Snape broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past Snape, missing Snape by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, Harry arm raised in triumph, the Snitchclasped in the Snitch hand.
----------------------------------------------
“Why should Professor Snape?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet Harry eyes when Harry said that.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

***********************************************
Filch
***********************************************

----------------------------------------------
Nick would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!” Even worse than Peeves the Poltergeist, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.
----------------------------------------------
Harry passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through Harry, and Harryslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, One bookFilch’s shrieks still ringing in Harry ears.
----------------------------------------------
As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.
----------------------------------------------
Argus Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust- colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch’s.
----------------------------------------------
Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity voice, but Peeves eyes glittered wickedly.
----------------------------------------------
This is the end!” they could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as Filch could toward the Fat Lady’s shouts.
----------------------------------------------
the Fat Lady’s robes had barely whipped round a corner when Neville’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
Hagrid relief must have showed in Hagrid face, because Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?
----------------------------------------------
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of Neville’s robes sprinted down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along a hidden passageway and came out near they Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
----------------------------------------------
“We’d better put cloak on here, and make sure cloak covers all three of We — if Filch spots one of We feet wandering along on its own — ” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the common room.
----------------------------------------------
